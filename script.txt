NONNBERG ABBEY. As the theatre darkens we hear 
the bells of Nonnberg Abbey. When the theatre is com- 
pletely dark the sound of the bells fades and we hear fem- 
inine voices chanting “Dixit Dominus.” 

SOLO. Dixit dominus domino meo: 
Sede a dextris meis 


the 


(In the darkness the curtain has risen and slowl: 
lights come up on the interior of Nonnberg Abbey. There is 
an altar with its lighted candles on one side, in the rear 
are vaulted arches and in the back wall a stained glass 
uindow. Across the stage, below all this, is a metal grille 
work. The singing continues:) 

RESPONSE: Donec ponam inimicos tuos, 
Scabelleum pedum tuorum 
SOLO Dominus 2 dextris tuis 
Confregit in die irae suae reges. 
RESPONSE: De torrente in via bibet 
Propterea in exaltabit caput. 
SOLO: Gloria Patri, et Filio, 
Et Spiritui Sancto. 
RESPONSE:  Sicut erat in principio, 
et nunc, et semper, 
et in saecula saeculorum. Amen. 
Rex admirabilis, 
Et triumphator nobilis, 
Dulcedo ineffabilis, 
Totus desiderabilis, 
Totus desiderabilis 


(During the chanting some nuns have approached the 
altar and knelt in prayer. Others have crossed in front of 
the grille, one earrying milk pails on a shoulder-yoke, 
another a large laundry basket, three or four with musical 
instruments. We hear the Angelus bells. All of the nuns 
kneel, bow their heads, crass themselves, then rise and go 
on about their business. The singing changes to ‘“‘Alle- 
luia.”” SISTER BERTHE enters with a notebook and pencil. 
As the nuns and postulants come on from various directions 
and pass her she checks their names off in the book. There 
seems to be someone missing. The singing has stopped and 
now we hear the voices of nuns coming from all over the 
Abbey.) 

VOICES: (As the lights dim out) 
Have you seen Maria? 
Isn’t Maria back yet? 
Where could Maria be? 
Where’s Maria? 
Maria! 
Maria! Maria! 
Maria! Maria! Maria!

Scene 2 


A mountainside near the Abbey. In the distance we see 
other mountains and Austrian countryside. Downstage is a 
large tree. MARIA is lyingon her back at the base of the 
base of the tree. Although she is dressed as a postulant, 
her position, with one foot high in the air and her petti- 


coat showing, is unpostulant-like. She sits up, looks 
around and starts to sing, 
MARIA: My day in the hills 
Has come to an end, I know. 
A star has come out 
To tell me it’s time to go. 
But deep in the dark green shadows 
‘Are voices that urge me to stay. 
So I pause and I wait and I listen 
For one more sound, 
Forone more lovely thing 
That the hills might say. . . 


The hills are alive 
With the sound of music, 
With songs they have sung 
For a thousand years. 

The hills fill my heart 
With the sound of music— 
My heart wants to sing 
Every song it hears. 


My heart wants to beat 
Like the wings 

Of the birds that rise 

From the lake to the trees. 
My heart wants to sigh 
Like a chime that flies 
From a church on a breeze, 
To laugh like a brook 
When it trips and falls 
Over stones in its way, 


MARIA: To sing through the night 
(Cont’d.) Like a lark who is learning to pray. 


Igo to the hills 

When my heart is lonely , 

T know T will hear 

What I’ve heard before, 

My heart will be blessed 

With the sound of music 

And I’ll sing once more. 

(The lights dim out and the traveller closes. SISTER 

SOPHIA enters below the traveller and crosses the stage 
carrying a large ring of keys.) 


Seene 3 


The office of the Mother Abbess. The spares ness of 
the furniture gives the sense of monastic austerity. There 
is adesk center, an armchair on one side, a stool on the 
other, a prie-dieu a short distance away. There is a door 
on either side of the room. On the desk: inkstand and pen 
and some papers inside a portfolio. Discovered are the 
MOTHER ABBESS, SISTER BERTHE and SISTER 
MARGARETTA. The MOTHER ABBESS, seated at left of 
desk is consulting a list of names on a sheet of paper. 
SISTER BERTHE, standing R. of desk, is holding in her 
hands a small black book and a pencil. SISTER MAR- 
GARETTA, standing R. of SISTER BERTHE, but apart, 
has her hands folded beneath the panel on the front of her 
habit. N.B. Nuns, when their hands are not employed, al- 
ways keep them out of sight beneath the panel of their 
habit, 


MOTHER ABBESS: I think we should be pleased with our 
efforts. Out of twenty-eight postulants, sixteen or sev- 
enteen are ready to enter the novitiate. Let’s consider 
the doubtful ones again. There’s Irmagard 

BERTHE: Reverend Mother, there’s no doubt about Irma- 
gard—the religious life is no place for the pious 

MOTHER ABBESS: You mean the pretentiously pious, Sis- 
ter Berthe, There’s Christina—and there’s Maria 

BERTHE: Well, after last night I don’t think there can be 
any doubt in the Reverend Mother’s mind about Maria. 

MOTHER ABBESS: I gave her permission to leave the 
Abbey for the day. 

MARGARETTA: (R. of BERTHE) | told you, Sister Berthe— 

(There is a knock on the door.) 

MOTHER ABBESS: Ave! 

(SISTER SOPHIA enters, comes to above desk.) 

SOPHIA: Reverend Mother, I’ve brought Maria. She’s 
waiting. 

MOTHER ABBESS: Sister Sophia, the Mistress of the 
Postulants and the Mistress of the Novices do not see 
eye to eye about Maria. How do you feel about her? 

SOPHIA; I love her very dearly. But she always seems to 
be in trouble, doesn’t she? 

BERTHE: (Crosses D.L.) Exactly what I say! (She sings.) 

She climbs a tree and scrapes her knee, 
Her dress has got a tear. 


SOPHIA: She waltzes on her way to Mass 
‘And whistles on the stair. 
BERTHE: And underneath her wimple 
She has curlers in her hair. 
SOPHIA: I've even heard her singing in the Abbey! 


(BERTHE moves to MOTHER ABBESS.)

BERTHE: She's always late for chapel~ 
SOPHIA: But her penitance is real. 
BERTHE She's always late for everything 

Except for every meal 

Thate to say it 

But I very firmly feel 
BERTHE and SOPHIA: 

Maria’s not an asset to the Abbey. 
MARGARETTA. 

I'd like to say a word in her behalf—

MOTHER ABBESS: (Speaks) Then say it, Sister Margaretta 
MARGARETTA: Maria... makesme. . . laugh! 

(AU look at SISTER BERTHE, then look front.) 
SOPHIA: How do you solve a problem like Maria? 
MOTHER ABBESS: 

How do you catch a cloud and pin it down? 
MARGARETTA; How do you find a word that means Maria? 
BERTHE: (Raising both hands) 

A flibbertijibbet! 
SOPHIA: (Raising both hands) 

A will-o'-wisp! 
MARGARETTA: (Raising both hands)

to MOTHER A.) And listen to all you say?

And I never know exactly where I am,

Unpredictable as weather, 
She's as flighty as a feather,

MARGARETTA: (To SISTER BERTHE) 
She's a darling 
BERTHE: (To SISTER MARGARETTA) 
She’s a demon 
MARGARETTA: (To SISTER BERTHE) 
She’s a lamb.

She'll out-pester any pest,

BERTHE: Reverend Mother, may I just 

MOTHER ABBESS: Now, my children, I think I should talk 
to Maria instead of about her. | am grateful to you all 
(The three sisters bow and exit U.R. There is aknock 

on the S.R. door. MOTHER ABBESS rises.) Ave! (MARIA 

enters. She has her arms folded across her chest with her 
hands concealed beneath the short cape of her habit.) 

Come here, my child. (MARIA crosses D.C., kneels and 

kisses MOTHER ABBESS’ ring.) Sit down, Maria, | want 

to talk to you. (MARIA sits on stool R. of desk.) 

MARIA: Yes—about last night. Reverend Mother, I was on 
my knees most of the night because I was late~and 
after you’d been so kind and given me permission to 
Jeave. . . 

MOTHER ABBESS: (Sits L. of desk) It wasn’t about your 
being late, Maria. . . 

MARIA: I must have awakened half the Abbey before Sister 
Margaretta heard me and opened the gate. 


-13- 


MOTHER ABBESS: Maria, very few of us were asleep. We 
could only think that you had lost your way—and to be 
lost at night on that mountain! 

MARIA: Reverend Mother, I couldn't be lost on that moun- 
tain. That’s my mountain. I was brought up on it! It 
was that mountain that brought me to you 

MOTHER ABBESS: Oh, . . ? 

MARIA: When I was a little girl I used to come down the 
mountain, climb a tree and look over into your garden. 
I'd see the sisters at work, and I’d hear them sing on 
their way to vespers. Many times I went back up that 
mountain in the dark—singing all the way. (MARIA 
clasps her hands together and raises them ubove her 
head in an exuberant ges ture. Then she catches her- 
self, gives a guilty glance toward the MOTHER AB- 
BESS, and puts her hands back beneath her cape.) And 
that brings up another transgression—I was singing yes 
terday—and I was singing without your permission. 

MOTHER ABBESS: Maria, it’s only here in the Abbey that 
there is a rule about singing. 

MARIA; That’s the hardest rule of all for me. Sister Mar. 
garetta is always reminding me—but too late, after I’ve 
started singing. 

MOTHER ABBESS: And the day you were singing in the 
garden at the top of your voice. 

MARIA: But Mother, it’s that kind of song, 

MOTHER ABBESS: I came to the window and when you 
saw me you stopped. 

MARIA: Yes-that’s been on my mind ever since it hap- 
pened. 

MOTHER ABBESS: It’s been on my mind, too. I wish you 
hadn’t stopped, I used to sing that song when I was a 
child, and I can’t quite remember—Please—

(She gestures to MARIA to sing.) 
MARIA: (Sitting, facing front, sings) 
Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens, 
Bright copper kettles and warm woolen 
mittens, 
(MOTHER ABBESS starts to write.) 
Brown paper packages tied up with strings— 
These are a few of my favorite things. 
(MOTHER ABBESS motions MARIA to rise. MARIA 
drops her hands, rises, takes stage and enjoys herself.) 
Cream colored ponies and crisp apple 
strudels, 
Doorbells and sleigh bells and schnitzel 
with noodles, 
Wild geese that fly with the moon on their 
wings— 
These are a few of my favorite things. 


Girls in white dresses with blue satin 
sashes, 

Snowflakes that stay on my nose and eye- 
lashes, 

Silver-white winters that melt into springs— 

These are a few of my favorite things. 


When the dog bites, 

When the bee stings, 

When I’m feeling sad, 

I simply remember my favorite things 

And then I don’t feel so bad!

(Swinging their arms 8 times, they end with their 
hands above their heads.) 

MARIA: (D.C., R. of MOTHER ABBESS) Mother! We were 
both singing at the top of our voices 

MOTHER ABBESS: (Crosses above desk to L. of chair) 
You're tight. It’s that kind of a song. 

MARIA: And singing it always makes me feel better. 
Mother, where did you learn that song? 

MOTHER ABBESS: I was brought up in the mountains my- 
self, (Motions MARIA to sit R. of desk.) Maria. . . in 
spite of what you saw over the Abbey wall, you weren't 
prepared for the way we live, were you? (Sits L. of 
desk.) 

MARIA: No, Mother, but I pray and I try. 

MOTHER ABBESS: Tell me, Maria, what is the most im- 
portant lesson you've learned here? 

MARIA: To find out what is the will of God and to do it 

MOTHER ABBESS: Even if it is hard to accept? 

MARIA: Even then, 

MOTHER ABBESS: (Rises, crosses D.L.C.) Maria, the 
dress you wore when you came to us-is that still in 
the robing room? 

MARIA: Why, no, Mother, I'm sure that’s been given to the 
poor, Sister Margaretta said that when we enter the 
Abbey our worldly clothes. . . Reverend Mother, why 
do you ask? 

MOTHER ABBESS: (Crosses to below L. chair) Maria, it 
seems to be the will of God that you leave us 

MARIA: Leave! Leave here! (Rises) Oh, no! Mother, 
please no! 

MOTHER ABBESS: For a while only, Maria. 

MARIA: Don’t send me away, Mother, please. This is what 
I want, This is my life.

MOTHER ABBESS: But are you ready for it? Perhaps if 
you go out into the world again for a time you will re- 
turn to us knowing what we expect of you and that we 
do expect it. 

MARIA: | know what you expect, Mother, and I’ll do it. T 
promise 

MOTHER ABBESS: Maria. 

MARIA: If it is God’s will. Where am I to go? 

MOTHER ABBESS: There’s a family—a family of seven 
children— (Sits L, of desk.) you like children-you're 
very good with them, They need a governess until 
September 

MARIA: Until September! 

MOTHER ABBESS: (Writing an address on paper) Captain 
von Trapp expects you this afternoon, He’s a fine man 
—and a brave one, He was given the Maria Teresa medal 
by the Emperor. It was for heroism in the Adriatic. 

MARIA: A Captain in the Navy! Oh, Mother, he’ll be very 
strict. 

MOTHER ABBESS: You're not being sent to his battleship. 
(She hands MARIA the adress. Abbey bells are heard. 
MARIA kneels, The MOTHER ABBESS makes the sign 
of the cross on MARIA’S forehead. ) God bless you, 
Maria. (She starts out.) 

MARIA: Reverend Mother? Have I your permission to sing? 

MOTHER ABBESS: Yes, my child. (She exits L. MARIA 
rises, She looks about the room regretfully, then starts 
aut singing to herself.) 

MARIA: These are a few of my favorite things.

ful look. MARIA stops singing and draws herself up spunk- 
ily.) Lhave been given permission to sing. (MARIA exits R.

ACT 


Scene 5 
The living room of the Trapp villa. It is a beautiful 


large room, two stories high, baroque in style and hand- 
somely furnished. D.L. there is a door to the dining room, 


-19- 


above this are two large French windows, opening on a 
terrace. Through these windows can be seen a mountain 


not too far in the distance, Between the two windows is a 
magnificent porcelain stove. D.R. is a door to the CAP- 
TAIN'S library. Upstage of this door a circular stairway 
curves to a second-floor landing, which forms a small 
baleony over the back of the living room. There is an exit, 
R., on the baleony, presumably leading to the other rooms 
on this floor. On the left of the balcony we see the first few 
steps of a curved staircase to the third floor. On the ground 
floor, upstage under the balcony, are double doors opening 
on the hallway which leads to the outer door of the house. 
off R. In the curve of the staircase are a small table and u 
side chair. Stage Left there is a sofa with a single chair at 
its right. A moment after the curtain has risen CAPTAIN 
GEORG VON TRAPP enters on the balcony from the R. He 
is dressed informally and is scanning a letter which he is 
holding in his hand. He stops at the railing of the balcony, 
takes a silver boatswain’s whistle from his pocket and 
blows « distinctive signal on it, He waits a few seconds 
and, as no one answers, he repeats the signal. Then he 
starts down the stairs, Halfway down, seeing no one has 
appeared, he blows a different signal. Almost immediately, 
FRANZ, the butler, enters D.L. He is a man of middle-age 
who was previously the CAPTAIN'S orderly in the Imperial 
Navy. He is dressed in a bulter’s working apron, is wearing 
gloves and is carrying a metal tray and a polishing cloth. 
FRANZ: Yes, sir? 
CAPTAIN: I was calling the housekeeper and she didn’t 
answer. Do you know why? 
FRANZ: Sometimes she doesn’t hear, sir. 
FRAU SCHMIDT: (Entering D.R.) 'm sorry, sir, | was an 


-20— 


swering the telephone, Good day, sir. We're happy to have 
you home again. 

CAPTAIN: Why did the last governess leave? 

FRAU SCHMIDT; Who knows? She just said, “I’ve had 
enough of this,” and walked out 

CAPTAIN: Why? Was Louisa playing tricks again?— Putt- 
ing toads in her bed? 

FRAU SCHMIDT; She didn’t complain of that, sir. 

CAPTAIN: (Crosses L., reading letter) Well, there’s an- 
other one coming today, And this one can’t walk out 

FRAU SCHMIDT: Oh? 

CAPTAIN: She's coming from Nonnberg Abbey with orders 
to stay until September. 

FRAU SCHMIDT: I hope you’ll be at home for a time, sir. 

CAPTAIN: Just until tomorrow. The telephone call—was it 
for me? 

FRAU SCHMIDT: No, sir, it was for Franz, Before you ar- 
tived there was a call from Vienna—a Frau Schraeder 
Ihave the number in the pantry 

CAPTAIN; (Crosses D.R.) I know the number. Oh, I shall 
be back in about a month with some guests. 

FRAU SCHMIDT: Yes, sir. Do you know how many, sir? 

CAPTAIN: Just two. Herr Detweiler— 

FRANZ: Ah, Her Detweiler. 

CAPTAIN: And Frau Schraeder. (He exits D.R.) 

FRANZ; Who wanted me on the telephone? 

FRAU SCHMIDT: It was the post office. They’ve got a 
telegram for you, It will be delivered at seven o'clock. 

FRANZ: Seven o’clock? That gives me five hours to be 
nervous. 

FRAU SCHMIDT: (Going up stairs) With that scatter- 
brained boy delivering telegrams— 

FRANZ: Well, that's one thing people are saying—if the 
Germans did take over Austria, we'd have efficiency. 


—21- 


FRAU SCHMIDT: Don't let the Captain hear you say that 
(The CAPTAIN whistles offstage. FRAU SCHMIDT 
stops short, bristling.) He didn’t whistle for us when 
his wife was alive. 

FRANZ: He’s being the captain of a ship again. 

(The CAPTAIN whistles again.) 

FRAU SCHMIDT: | can’t bear being whistled for—it’s 
humiliating 

FRANZ: In the Imperial Navy, the bo’s’un always whis- 
tled for us. (We hear the doorbell.) 

FRAU SCHMIDT; But I wasn't in the Imperial Navy 

FRANZ: Too bad, You could have made a fortune. (Ie 
exits into the hallway toward the outer door. FRAU 
SCHMIDT comes down the stairs and exits into the ti- 
brary D.R. FRANZ re-enters, followed by MARIA.) You 
will wait here. (He exits D.R. MARIA is wearing a 
dress that has been designed by an enemy of the fe- 
male sex, and an unbecoming hat. She is carrying a 
small carpet bag aud a guitar in its case. She comes 
down into the room timidly and looks around in awe at 
the handsome embellishments. Ske puts the guitar case 
doun on the floor and starts toward the windows, touch- 
ing the porcelain stove admiringly as she passes it 
In the distance we hear the Abbey bells. She kneels and 
bows her head in a brief prayer. The CAPTAIN enters 
from the library D.R., the letter still in his hand. As he 
sees MARIA in prayer, he stops. MARIA crosses her- 
self and rises.) 

CAPTAIN: l’m Captain von Trapp. You are Fraulein. 

MARIA: Maria—Maria Rainer. 

CAPTAIN: Now, Fraulein, as to your duties here-(He 
suddenly becomes aware of her dress.) Would you mind 
stepping over there? (Ie indicates a spot in the center 


-22- 


) 


of the room. MARIA slouly moves to it.) Before the 
children meet you, you will put on another dress. 

MARIA: | haven’t any other dress When we enter the Ab- 
bey our worldly clothes are given to the poor. 

CAPTAIN: What about this one? 

MARIA: The poor didn’t want this one 

CAPTAIN: Thisis what you would call a worldly dress? 

MARIA: It belonged to our last postulant. I would have 
made myself a dress but I wasn’t given time. I can make 
my own clothes. 

CAPTAIN: Good. Ill see that you’te given some material— 
today if possible. Now, you will be in charge of my chil- 
dren. There are seven of them. You will find out how far 
they have progressed in their studies and carry on from 
there, Each morning will be spent in the classtoom. 
Each afternoon, they march, You will see that at all 
limes they conduct themselves with decorum and order- 
liness. The first rule in this house is discipline. 

MARIA: Yes, sir. 

(The CAPTAIN takes out his silver whistle and blows 

@ siren-like summoning blast which continues while his 

children enter from both sides of the balcony, the outside 

door, the French windows and the library, and end by form 
ing a single line with GRETL, and MARTA on the stairs, 

KURT, LOUISA, FRIEDRICH and LIESL, in that order, on 

the balcony behind them. They are dressed in white sailor 

uniforms; the girls, of course, in white shirts. The CAP- 

TAIN changes his signal to one that marks time for march 

ing, and, led by GRETL, they march down the stairs and, 

with a military left turn at the foot of the stairs, line up 
across the stage. MARIA has watched this with consider- 
able astonishment. There is an empty space between MAR- 

TA and KURT. Slowly through the diningroom door, BRIG- 


-23- 


ITTA enters, reading a book. The CAPTAIN sees her, 
takes the book away from her, puts it on the sofa and 
gives her an admonishing pat on the behind, which sends 
her running to take her place in formation. The CAPTAIN 
crosses in front of them to the other side of LIESL and 
addresses them.) 

CAPTAIN: This is your new fraulein—Fraulein Matia. As 
I sound your signal you will step forward and repeat 
your name. You, Fraulein, will listen and lear their 
signals so that you can call them when you want them 

(He whistles their various signals. Each child responds 
to hisor her sigaal, stepping forward in a military manner, 
announcing his or ker name, then stepping back into line. 

The CAPTAIN crosses below the children to MARIA, taking 

from his pocket a velvet case which holds another boats- 

wain’s whistle. He hands it to MARIA.) Now, Fraulein, let’s 
see how well you listened. (MARIA, slightly bewildered, 

takes the uhistle from its case. The CAPTAIN crosses D.R) 

MARIA: I won't have to whistle for them, Reverend Captain 
—What I mean is, I'll be with them all the time. 

CAPTAIN; Not on all occasions. This is a large house and 
a large estate. They have been taught to come only when 
they hear their signal. Now when I want you, this is what 
you'll hear. (The CAPTAIN whistles the governess’ sig- 
nal.) 

MARIA: You won't have to trouble, sir, because I couldn't 
answer to a whistle. 

CAPTAIN: That's nonsense, Everyone in this house an. 
swers to a whistle. I'll show you. (He whistles the but-

MARIA: Pardon me, sir-I don’t know how to address you, 

CAPTAIN: You will call me Captain 

MARIA: (Crosses to CAPTAIN) Thank you, Captain. I for- 
got to return this whistle, Captain. I won’t need it, Cap- 
tain, (He takes the whistle and exits D.R. FRANZ and 
FRAU SCHMIDT exit to third floor. She turns tw children 
with a handelap, catching them off guard.) Well, now 
that there’s just us, would you tell me your names again, 
and tell me how old you are. Now you're—? 

(Each child, in turn, steps forward in military manner, 

s, and then steps back.) 

«I’m Liesl, I’m sixteen years old and I don’t need a 
governess, 

MARIA: (R. of LIESL) I'm glad you told me. We'll just be 
friends. (LIESL steps back. FRIEDRICH steps forward.) 

FRIEDRICH: I’m Friedrich. I’m fourteen. I'ma boy. 

MARIA: (R. of FRIEDRICH) Boy? Why, you're almost a man. 

(FRIEDRICH looks pleased. LOUISA signals the other 
girls, who giggle.) 

LOUISA: I’m Brigitta: 

MARIA: (Crosses behind LOUISA, pulling up her braid) You 
didn’t tell me how old you are, Louisa

BRIGITTA: (Steps L. of MARIA) I’m Brigitta, She's Lou. 
isa and she’s thirteen years old and you're smart. I’m 
nine and I think your dress isthe ugliest one | ever saw. 

KURT: (Steps R. of MARIA) Brigitta, you mustn't say a 
thing like that 

BRIGITTA: Why not? Don’t you think it’s ugly? 

KURT: If I did think so, I wouldn't say so. (Snapping 
to attention.) I'm Kurt, I’m eleven—almost 

MARIA: That’s a nice age to be, eleven—almost 

MARTA: (Steps forward L. of MARIA, pulling her skirt) T'm 
Marta and I’m going to be seven on Tuesday and I'd like 
a pink parasol 

MARIA; Pink is my favorite color, too. (GRETL steps for- 
ward and stamps her foot,)And you're Gretl, (CRETL 
smiles and jumps into her arms. MARIA crosses L.C.) 
I'm going to tell you something. (MARIA sits on chair R 
of sofa, puts GRETL on floor R. of her.) I've never been 
a governess before, How do I start? 

LOUISA: (Runs to MARIA) You mean you don’t know any- 
thing about being a governess? 

MARIA: No. 

LOUISA: Well, the first thing you have to do is to tell 
Father to mind hisown business. 

KURT: No, Louisa, don’t. | like her. 

BRIGITTA: (Above chair, picking up guitar case) What's in 
here? 

MARIA: My guitar. 

BRIGITTA: What did you bring this for? 

MARIA: For when we all sing together. 

MARTA: (BRIGITTA takes guitar out of case) We don’t sing, 

MARIA: Of course you sing. Everybody sings. What songs 
so you know? 

KURT: We don't know any songs.

MARIA: (Taking guitar from BRIGITTA) You don't? 
ALL: No. 
MARIA: Well. . . Now I know where to start. I’m going to 
teach you how to sing. (Sings.) 
Let's start at the very beginning, 
A very good place to start.

call a song? Do te mi fa so and so on? 

MARIA: (Speaks) No. Do re mi fa so and so on are only the 
tools we use to build a song. Once we have these notes 
in aur heads we can sing a million different tunes, 

FRIEDRICH: How? 

MARIA: By mixing them up. Listen. (Sings. /

Scene 6 


Outside the villa A shallow scene showing the villa 
and wall that runs around it. D.L.C. is a stone bench. 
After a moment LIESL enters D.R., turns and waves to 
someone offstage. 

LIESL: Good night, Rolf, 

ROLF: (Walking on with his bicycle) Liesl! 

LIESL: (Going to him) Yes?. 

ROLF: You don’t have to say good night this early just 
because your father’s home— 

LIESL: How did you know my father was home? 

ROLF: Oh, I have a way of knowing things. 

LIESL: You’re wonderful, 

ROLF: (Resting the bicycle on its stand) Oh, no, I'm not 
—teally 


=31= 


LIESL: (Crosses D.L.) Oh, yes, you ate. I mean—how did 
you know two days ago that you would be here at just 
this time tonight with a telegram for Franz? 

ROLF: (Following her) Every year on this date he always 
gets a birthday telegram from his sister. 

LIESL: You see—you are wonderful, 

ROLF: Can I come again tomorrow night? 

LIESL: (Sitting on the bench) Rolf, you can’t be sure you're 
going to have a telegram to deliver here tomorrow night. 

ROLF: (Sitting beside her) 1 could come here by mistake— 
with a telegram for Colonel Schneider. He’s here from 
Berlin. He’s staying with the Gauleiter but I-/Suddenly 
concerned.) No one’s supposed to know he’s here. Don’t 
you tell your father 

LIESL: Why not? 

ROLF: Well, your father’s pretty Austrian. 

LIESL: We're all Austrian, 

ROLF: Some people think we ought to be German. They’re 
pretty mad at those who don’t think so. They're getting 
ready to—well, let’s hope your father doesn’t get into 
any trouble, (He goes to his bicycle.) 

LIESL: (Rising) Don’t worry about father, He was decorated 
for bravery. 

ROLF: I know. I don’t worry about him. The only one I worry 
about is his daughter. 

LIESL: (Above bench) Me? Why? 

(ROLF gestures to her to stand on the bench, She does 
and he studies her.) 

ROLF: How old are you, Liesl? 

LIESL: Sixteen—What's wrong with that? 

ROLF: (Singing) 

You wait, little girl, on an empty stage 
For fate to turn the light on, 


—32- 


LIESL: 
ROLF: 


Your life, little girl, is an empty page 
That men will want to write on. 

To write on. 

You are sixteen going on seventeen, 
Baby, it’s time to think 

Better beware, 

Be canny and careful 

Baby, you're on the brink. 


You are sixteen going on seventeen, 
Fellows will fall in line. 

Eager young lads 

And roués and cads 

Will offer you food and wine. 


Totally unprepared are you 
To face a world of men. 

Timid and shy and scared are you 
Of things beyond your ken. 

You need someone older and wiser 
Telling you what to do. 


(LIESL sits on the bench.) 


1am seventeen going on eighteen, 


(ROLF sits and puts his arm around her shoulder.) 


(LIESL dances. At the end of the dance ROLF gets on 
his bicycle as if to leave; Ll 


Tl take care of you 


L hurries to him.) 


LIESL: (Singing) 


Iam sixteen going on seventeen, 
I know that I’m naive, 
Fellows I meet 

May tell me I’m sweet 

And willingly I'll believe.

1 am sixteen going on seventeen, 
Innocent as a rose. 

(ROLF moves bicycle D.S. Ske follows.) 
Bachelor dandies, 
Drinkers of Brandies, 
What do I know of those? 

(ROLF moves bicycle slowly S.R. LIES 

Totally unprepared am I 
To face a world of men. 
Timid and shy and scared am I 
Of things beyond my ken. 
I need someone older and wiser.

Telling me what to do,

You are seventeen going on eighteen, 
T’ll depend on you. (Dance) 

(She assumes doll-like position. He carrects her by 
moving her arms. He snaps his fingers and she does a 
Spanish step. She starts to waltz and gets confused be- 
cause she does not know what to do with her arms. He then 
directs her, and she does a dance at the end of which she 
puts her arms around him. They kiss tentatively, then she 
puts his arm around her waist and they kiss more fervently. 
ROLF breaks away in confusion, jumps on his bicycle and 
races off D.R. LIESL, feeling she has made progress, jumps 
with joy and shouts “Yow!” She runs off D.L.)

ACTI 
Scene 7 


Maria’s Bedroom. The gabled ceiling suggests it is on 
the top floor of the villa.. The door from the hallway is in the 
upstage wall. At the left of this door is a wardrobe with 
double doors. The left wall slants away from this and in it 
is a window. To the right of the door to the hall is an al- 
cove, curtained off with drapes of yellow and brown creton- 
ne, matching the drapes of the window. Below the alcove, 
in a jog, is MARIA’s double brass bed with a thick cider. 
down comforter. Guitar case on floor D.S. of window. There 
is a knocking on the door. 

FRAU SCHMIDT: (Off) Fraulein Maria! (She enters U.C. 
carrying a bolt of cloth.) Fraulein Matia, it’s Frau 
Schmidt. 

MARIA: (Off) I’m getting ready for bed. 

FRAU SCHMIDT: The Captain is going to Vienna tomorrow. 
Thave this material he ordered for a new dress for you. 

MARIA: (Off) Oh, how nice of him. (She enters from the al- 
cove, wearing @ nightgown under a dressing robe. FRAU 

HMIDT hands her the bolt of material.) Even betore 

it's made, this is the prettiest dress I’ve ever had. I 
hope the Captain will like it because I want to ask him 
for more material 

FRAU SCHMIDT; More? 

MARIA: Oh, not for me—for the children, For play clothes. 

(She takes the material into the alcove.) 

FRAU SCHMIDT: The Von Trapp children never play. 
(Crosses to the window and closes the curtains.) The 
Captain doesn’t like them to get dirty. 

MARIA: (Re-entering) But they’re children. They have to 
climb trees, roll on the grass. Think of all the rocks and 


caves— 


=35- 


FRAU SCHMIDT; The Captain says the best exercise is 
marching, The children will continue to march, I hope 
you find your room comfortable. 

MARIA: Yes, thank you, 

FRAU SCHMIDT: (Going to the bed and adjusting the eider- 

down comforter) There will be new curtains for the 
window and the alcove. They will be hung tomorrow. 

MARIA: (At the window) But these curtains are very good. 

FRAU SCHMIDT: There will be new curtains. 

MARIA: (Measuring the drapes at arm’s length from her nose, 
Will the Captain be away long? 

FRAU SCHMIDT: I don’t know, Of course he has to come 
home every time he hires a new governess. I sometimes 
think the children get rid of their governesses just be- 
cause they want to see their father 

MARIA: (Picking up her guitar case) He must want to see 
them, too. 

FRAU SCHMIDT: Since his wife died, they remind him too 
much of her. (Seeing the guitar.) You can put that away. 
You won’t be using it. 

MARIA: Why not? 

FRAU SCHMIDT: The Captain won't have music here. 

MARIA: He won’t have music??? 

FRAU SCHMIDT: And he used to love music. There were 
wonderful evenings here. His wife would sing andhe 
would play the violin or guitar. But now he’s shut all 
that out of his life 

MARIA: So that’s why he's the way he is. But not to have 
music—that’s wrong for him and wrong for the children, 
too. (She puts the guitar in the alcove.) 

FRAU SCHMIDT: It will work out. The Captain may marry 
again before the summer is over. 


a862 


MARIA: (Re-entering) That would change everything, They'd 
have @ mother again. 

FRAU SCHMIDT: (Dismissingly) It's going to rain. You'd 
better close your window. (She exits U.S. MARIA goes 
to the bed and kneels in prayer.) 

MARIA: Dear God, I know now that You have sent me here 
on a mission. I must help these children to love their 
new mother and prepare them to win her love so she will 
never want them to leave her. And I pray that this will 
become a happy family in Thy sight. God bless the Cap- 
tain, God bless Liesl, and Friedrich, Louisa, Brigitta, 
Marta, and little Gretl—and oh, yes, I forgot the other 
boy-what’s his name? Well, God bless what’s-his-name! 
(There is lightning and thunder. LIESL enters through 
the window. Her dress is smudged with dirt. She tiptoes 
to the hall door. MARIA sees her out of the comer of her 
eye, but continues.) God bless the Reverend Mother, and 
Sister Margaretta and everybody at Nonnberg Abbey. And 
now, dear God, about Liesl— (L/ESL stops and gives 
MARIA a startled look.) Help her to know that I am her 
friend and help her to tell me what she’s up to. 

LIESL: Are you going to tell on me? 

MARIA: (Silencing her with a gesture) Help me to be under- 
standing so that I may guide her footsteps. In the name 
of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost 
Amen, (MARIA rises.) 

LIESL:; (Crosses C.)1 was out taking a walk and somebody 
locked the doors earlier than usual—and I didn’t want to 
wake everybody up-so when I saw your window open— 
You're not going to tell Father, are you? 

MARIA: (Looking out the window) Did you climb that trellis 
to get up here? 


-37- 


LIESL: That’s how we always got into this room to play 
tricks on the governess. (Proudly.) Louisa can climb it 
with a toad in her hand. 

MARIA: Liesl, were you out walking all by yourself? 
(LIESL shakes her head negatively.) You know, if we 
wash that dress out tonight, nobody would notice it to- 
morrow. Then all this would be just between you and me. 
You could put this on— (She takes off her robe and puts 
it around LIFSL'S shoulders.) Take your dress in there— 
and put it to soak in the bathtub. (I'hunder and light- 
ning. They embrace each other in fright.) Then come 
back here and sit on the edge of my bed and we'll have 
a talk. 

LIESL: I told you today I didn’t need a governess, Well, 
maybe I do. (She exits into the alcove. Lightning and 
thunder. MARIA jumps, then crosses to the bed and peers 
under the comforter looking for possible toads. GRETL 
enters U.C. in her night dress.) 

MARIA: Oh, it’s you, Gretl. Are you aftaid? (GRET'L shakes 
her head. Thunder and lightning. GRETL jumps up on the 
bed with MARIA.) You're not afraid of a thunderstorm, are 
you? You just stay right here with me, Where are the othe 

GRETL: They're asleep. They're not scared 

(Thunder and lightning. BRIGITTA, LOUISA and MART. 
run on U.C. in their nightdresses. ) 

MARTA: Wait for me. 

MARIA: (To GRETL) Oh, no? Look. (To the others.) 

Come, all of you. Up on the bed. (All three girls jump 
up on the bed.) Now all we have to do is wait for the 
boys. 

LOUISA: We won't see them! Boys are brave. 

(Thunder and lightning. KURT and FRIEDRICH enter 

U.C. in their pajamas.) 

MARIA: You boys aren’t frightened, too, are you? 

KURT: Oh, no, We just wanted to be sure you weren't 

MARIA: Was this your idea, Friedrich? 


FRIEDRICH: Oh, no. It was Kurt's. 
MARIA: That’s it, Kurt. That’s the one I left out. 
(Looking up.) God bless Kurt. 
(Lightning and thunder. The boys run and cower at the 
foot of the bed.) 

MARTA: Why does it do that? 

MARIA: Well, the lightning says something to the thunder 
and the thunder answers it back. 

MARTA: I wish it wouldn’t answer so loud. 

MARIA: Maybe if we all sing loud enough we won’t hear 
the thunder. (The children climb off the bed and sit in 
semicircle at its foot. MARIA sits on D.S. edge of bed. 
The children are in the following order from S.R.: KURT, 
MARTA, GRETL, BRIGITTA, LOUISA, FRIEDRICH. 
MARIA sings.)

ACT I 
Scene 9 


The terrace of the Trapp villa. The villa is S.R. Since 
the terrace is off the living room, people entering from the 
house come through the French windows which we have seen 
in the living room. Over these windows is a striped awning. 
Convenient to these windows are a terrace table and two 
chairs. On the table is a tray with coffee service. From the 
upstage end of the house a short balustrade-starts toward 
S.L., a potted plant on its terminal post. There is an exit 
toward the gardens on SL. between this balustrade and a 
boxuood hedge on the left side of the terrace. In front of 
this hedge is a garden bench and a stool. The view the 
audience sees beyond the villa is of the Alps. At Rise: 
FRANZ is standing behind the table, pouring coffee. ELSA 
SCHRAEDER, a handsome woman in her late thirties, cos- 
mopolitan, alert and attractive, is seated left of the table 
admiring the view of other mountains somewhere beyond the 
audience. CAPTAIN VON TRAPP is standing center, ad- 
miring ELSA. 

CAPTAIN: Franz, did you tell Herr Detweiler we're hav- 
ing coffee out here? 

FRANZ: Yes, sit. Herr Detweiler is still on the telephone. 

(URSULA enters from the house with a tray of pastry.) 

URSULA: (Offering tray) Frau Schraeder? 

ELSA: Oh, thank you. (ELSA takes a small plate of lady- 
fingers and puts it on the table. URSULA exits into the 
house.) 

CAPTAIN: No sign of the children, Franz? 

FRANZ: Not yet, sir. (FRANZ exits into house.)

ELSA: (Rising, taking his arm, crosses D.C.) Georg, those 
mountains—they’re magnificent! 

CAPTAIN: Yes, they're not like any other mountains—they’re 
friendly. Look, that green stretch of woods over there— 
when the wind moves through it, it’s like a restless sea. 

ELSA: And that sweet little village. 

CAPTAIN: That’s not a village. That’s a town. 

ELSA: Oh, I’m sorry—I didn’t mean to hutt its feelings. 

CAPTAIN: (Crosses in to her) It’s fun being with you 
You're quite an experience for me. 

ELSA: You're quite an experience for me, too. Somewhere 
in you there’s a fascinating man. Occasionally I catch 
a glimpse of him, and when I do, he’s exciting. (She sits 
L. of table.) 

CAPTAIN: (Crosses up to L. of her) Exciting? I’ve never 
been called exciting before. 

ELSA: I'm beginning to understand you better now that I see 
you here~ You know, you're a little like those mountains— 
(He crosses D.L.C.) except that you keep moving. How 
can you be away from this place as much as you are? 

CAPTAIN: Maybe I’ve been searching for a reason to come 
back here to stay. 

ELSA: Georg, | like it here very much. 

CAPTAIN: (Embarassed) Max can’t still be on the telephone, 
(Crosses above coffee table-R. of ELSA.) 1 know he’s 
desperate about getting singers for the Kaltzberg Festi- 
val but— (1'0 ELSA.) You like it here? 

ELSA: Oh, we'd have to spend some time in Vienna, I have 
Heinrich’s estate to look after. 

CAPTAIN: I thought that was a corporation now. 

ELSA: It is, and I’m president 

CAPTAIN: You president of a corporation! 

ELSA: After all, I managed Heinrich’s affairs for years be- 
fore he died.

CAPTAIN: I can’t see you sitting behind a desk. (He sits 
R. of coffee table.) 

ELSA: Well, of course, I wear a business suit and smoke a 
big cigar. (FRANZ enters from the house.) 

FRANZ: Excuse me, Captain, Herr Detweiler would like his 
coffee. 

CAPTAIN: While he’s telephoning? 

FRANZ: He just finished. 

(FRANZ pours a cup of coffee. MAX DETWEILER 
enters, He is charming and vital. He carries a small note- 
book and pencil.) 

MAX: I'm sorry I took so long. 

CAPTAIN: Any luck? 

MAX: How would you like this for the Kaltzberg Festival— 
the finest choral group in Austria, the greatest mixed 
quartet in all Europe—and the best soprano in the world? 

ELSA: Max, that’s something I’d love to hear! 

MAX: So would I. (MAX sits on stool D.l..) All I've got up 
to now is a basso who isn’t even profundo. 

(FRANZ exits into the house.) 

ELSA: Max, you always come up with a good Festival Con- 
cert. 

(The CAPTAIN takes MAX a cup of coffee with a piece 
of pastry on the saucer.) 

MAX: And why? Because my motto is: “Never start out look- 
ing for the people you wind up getting.” That's why I've 
been telephoning Paris, Rome, Stockholm, London— 

ELSA: On Georg’s telephone? 

MAX: How else could I afford it? Why am I up here? 

CAPTAIN: I hoped it was because you liked me. 

MAX: Of course I like you. Why shouldn’t I like you? You 
live like a king. You have an excellent wine cellar— 

ELSA: Max!

MAX: I like rich people, I like the way they live. I like the 
way / live when I’m with them. (We hear the Abbey bells. ) 
Speaking as a government official, [-Georg, is there a 
cathedral around here? 

CAPTAIN: That’s our Abbey—Nonnberg Abbey. 

MAX: Do they have a choir? 

CAPTAIN: A beautiful one. 

MAX: Good! In the next few days I have to visit all these 
towns around here and listen to saengerbunds, choirs, 
quartets— 

CAPTAIN; You'll be here for meals, won't you? 

MAX: Oh, yes! (MAX rises and looks off over the heads of 
the audience, where MAX plainly sees a mountain vil- 
lage.) It was in a town just about that size—Watzmann 
—where I discovered the St. Ignatius Boys Choir. In 1930 
they won the Festival, became very famous, toured all 
over the world 

ELSA: Oh, yes-whatever became of them? 

MAX: By the time their voices changed they were rich 
enough to live in America. (Indicating. ) Who lives in 
that dilapidated castle down there? Rumpelstiltskin? 

CAPTAIN: Baron Elberfeld. The oldest family in the valley. 

ELSA: I'd like to meet him. I’d like to meet all your friends. 
Georg, why don’t you give a dinner for me while I’m here? 
Nothing very much—just something lavish. 

CAPTAIN: I wouldn’t know whom to invite. Today it’s dif- 
ficult to tell who’s a friend and who’s an enemy. 

ELSA: This isn’t a good time to make enemies. Let’s make 
some friends. 

(Wishing to change the subject, the CAPTAIN goes up- 
stage and looks off.) 

CAPTAIN: I can’t understand what’s happened to the chil- 
dren. 

ELSA: You're not wortied about them, are you? 


-~46- 


CAPTAIN: They should have been here to welcome you 

ELSA: It couldn't have been an intentional slight because 
they haven’t met me yet. 

CAPTAIN: Forgive me, I'll try to find them, (He exits U,L.) 

MAX: Elsa, have you made up Georg’s mind yet? Is he go- 
ing to marry you? 

ELSA: Oh, yes! He hasn’t admitted it yet. There seems to 
be something standing in his way. 

MAX: (Crosses C.) You don’t know what it is? 

ELSA: No. 

MAX: I do. 

ELSA: (Rises) What? 

MAX: It’s very simple. It’s money. (Takes her arm, crosses 
D.C.) 

ELSA: Money? 

MAX: Yes. He’s rich and you’re rich. (He sings, D.C. ELSA 
crosses D.R.) 

In all the famous love affairs 

‘The lovers have to struggle. 

In garret rooms away upstairs 

‘The lovers starve and snuggle. 
They’re famous for misfortune which 
‘They seem to have no fear of, 

While lovers who are very rich 

You very seldom hear of. 

CAPTAIN: (Enters U.L. and crosses D.R.C. Speaking) 
Not a sign of them anywhere. . . (MAX pushes ELSA 
towards CAPTAIN.) 

ELSA: (Clutching CAPTAIN) 

No little shack do you share with me, 
We do not flee from a mortgagee, 
Nary a care in the world have we— 
(She crosses to MAX.) 
MAX: How can love survive? 


=47= 


ELSA: (Crosses back to CAPTAIN) 
You're fond of bonds and you own a lot, 
Ihave a plane and a diesel yacht, 
MAX: (Between ELSA and CAPTAIN) 
Plenty of nothing you haven't got! 
MAX and ELSA: 
How can love survive? 
ELSA: (S.R.) No rides for us 
On the top of a bus 
In the face of the freezing breezes— 
MAX: You reach your goals 
(To the CAPTAIN.) 
In your comfy old Rolls! 
(To ELSA.) 
Or in one of your Mercedeses! (Signal.) 
ELSA: (Moving back) 
Far, very far off the beam are we, 
Quaint and bizarre as a team are we, 
Two millionaires with a dream are we, 
We're keeping romance alive, 
Two millionaires with a dream are we— 
We'll make our love survive. 


No little cold water flat have we, 
(Mouing to C.) 
Warmed by the glow of insolvency— 
MAX: (Stopping CAPTAIN) 
Up to your necks in security, 
How can love survive? 
ELSA How can I show what I feel for you? 
I cannot go out and steal for you 
(Takes MAX’s kerchief.) 
I cannot die like Camille for you— 
How can love survive? 
(Crosses and returns kerchief.) 


-48— 


MAX: (Calling them to him) 
You millionaires 
With financial affairs 
Are too busy for simple pleasure. 
When you are poor 
It is toujours !’amour— 

(Bending ELSA back.) 

For l’amour all the poor have leisure! 

ELSA: (To the CAPTAIN) 

Caught in our gold-plated chains are we, 
Lost in our wealthy domains are we, 

es C.) 

Trapped by our capital gains are we— 

(Holds CAPTAIN.) 

But we'll keep romance alive— 

(MAX turns out his empty trouser pockets.) 

MAX. Trapped by our capital gains are we 

ELSA: We'll make our love survive! 

(At the end of the number, ROLF enters U.L., looking 
for LIESL. He is concentrating on the upstairs windows of 
the villa so completely, he doesn’t see the others.) 
CAPTAIN: (to ROLF) What do you want? 

ROLF: (Startled) Oh, Captain. . . | don’t see, | mean, | 
didn’t know. . . er, uh, . . Heil! (He holds his hand up 
in salute.) 

CAPTAIN: (Icily) Who are you? 

ROLF: I have a telegram for Herr Detweiler. 

MAX: (Taking the telegram from ROLF) 1 am Herr Detweiler 

CAPTAIN: You've delivered your telegram, now get out! 

(ROLF exits U.L., flustered.) 

ELSA: Georg, he’s just a boy! 

CAPTAIN: I am an Austrian—I will not be heiled! 

MAX: Georg, why don’t you look at things the way | do? 
Whats going to happen is going to happen. Just be sure 
it doesn’t happen to you.

(ELSA exits into the house.) 

CAPTAIN: Max, it’s a good thing you haven't any character, 
because if you had I’m convinced I’d hate you. 

MAX: You couldn't hate me. I’m too lovable. 

(FRANZ enters from the house.) 

FRANZ: Herr Detweiler, there’s a call for you, It’s from— 

MAX: (Quickly) I'll take it 

(MAX exits into the house, followed by FRANZ. At 
this moment the CAPTAIN’s attention is attracted by the 
sound of voices yodeling and coming from the direction of 
the garden. U.L., GRETL runs on and stoops over. 
we see MARTA leapfrog over G: 
followed by BRIGITTA, KUR 
LIESL, all leapfrogging. They are dressed in playclothes 
made from the curtains we have seen in MARIA’s bedroom. 
The last one on, yodeling along with the children, dressed 
ina dirndl made from the material the CAPTAIN sent her, 
is MARIA. Her leapfrogging takes her to the feet of the 
CAPTAIN. She straightens up in pleased surprise.) 

MARIA: Oh, Captain—you're home! 

CHILDREN: (Joy/ully) Father! Father, you’re home! 

(The CAPTAIN takes his whistle from his pocket and 
blows a premptory blast. The children, dismayed, line up 
in military fashion.) 

CAPTAIN: Straight line! (The CAPTAIN crosses behind 
them, inspecting their strange garb with evident dis- 
pleasure. He takes a kerchief made of the curtain ma- 
terial from LOUISA’s head.) Get cleaned up! Get into 
your uniforms and report back here! (The children glance 
appealingly toward MARIA.) At once! (The children run 
into the house.) Fraulein! Where did they get these ab- 
ominations—out of a nightmare? 

MARIA: No, out of some curtains—the curtains that used to 
hang in my bedroom. There was plenty of wear left in 
them. 


—50- 


CAPTAIN: Just a moment. Do you mean to say the people 
of the neighborhood have seen my children wearing old 
curtains? 

MARIA: Oh, yes, they’ve become very popular. Everyone 
smiles at them. 

CAPTAIN: I don’t wonder. 

MARIA: They say, “There go Captain von Trapp’s children? 

CAPTAIN: My children have always been a credit to my 

name 

MARIA: But, Captain, they weren’t. They were just unhappy 

little marching machines. 

CAPTAIN: I don’t care to hear from you about my children 

MARIA: Well, you must hear from someone, You're not home 

long enough to know them 

CAPTAIN: I said I don’t want to hear— 

MARIA: I know you don’t~but you’ve got to, Take Lies!— 
Liesl isn’t a child any more. And if you keep treating 
her as one, Captain, you're going to have a mutiny on 
your hands. And Friedrich—Friedrich’s afraid to be him- 
self—he’s shy—he’s aloof, Friedrich needs you-he needs 
your confidence— 

CAPTAIN: Don’t tell me about my son. 

MARIA: Brigitta could tell you about him, She could tell you 
a lot more if you got to know her, because she notices 
things. And she always tells the truth-especially when 
you don’t want to hear it. Kurtis sensitive—he’s easily 
hurt-and you ignore him—you brush him aside the way you 
do all of them. (The CAPTAIN starts to leave./I haven't 
finished yet! Louisa—wants to have a good time. You've 
just got to let her have a good time, Marta—I don’t know 
about yet—but someone has to find out about her. And 
little Gretl—just wants to be loved—Oh, please, Captain, 
love Gretl, love all of them. They need you. 

CAPTAIN: Stop! Stop it! You will pack your things and re- 
turn to the Abbey as soon as you can.

MARIA: I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have said those things—not 
in the way I said them.

What's that? For a thousand years. 
MARIA: Singing. 
CAPTAIN: Who’s singing? The hills fill my heart 
MARIA; Your children. With the sound of music 
CAPTAIN: My children My heart wants to sing 
singing? Every song it hears. 


MARIA: I wanted them to 
sing for Frau Schraeder 
when they met her. 

(ELSA enters from the upper French windows, going 
toward the CAPTAIN, who is D.L. She stops L. of C. The 
children follow ELSA on, still singing, FRIEDRICH ac- 
companying them on a guitar. They stand in a diagonal line 
in front of the French windows.) 

ELSA: Georg, you must hear— 
CHILDREN: (Singing) 
My heart wants to beat 
Like the wings 
Of the birds that rise 
From the lake to the trees, 
My heart wants to sigh 
Like a chime that flies 
From a church on a breeze. 

(The CAPTAIN turns front and joins in the song.)

My heart will be blessed

And [’ll sing once more. 

(As the song finishes there is a moment of poignant si- 
lence. GRETL, who is carrying a white flower, looks toward 
MARIA. MARIA nods to her. GRETL goes to ELSA, touches 
her skirt, curtsies, and hands her the flower.) 

ELSA: (Toucked) Edelweiss! Georg, why haven’t you told 
me how enchanting your children are? 

(The CAPTAIN goes 0 GRETL C. andputs hi 
around her. He motions the other children to him. 
younger ones surround him. He puts his other arm around 
MARTA, then reaches out and gently ruffles KURT’ hair. 
When he speaks it is not easy for him to control his voice.) 
CAPTAIN: Children, I'd like to have you show Frau 

Schraeder the gardens. 

ELSA: Yes, show me the gardens~ (ELSA and the children 
start of L., all talking simultaneously.) 1 want to see 
everything, and with you, too. I don’t know any of your 
names yet, but it doesn’t matter. I’m sure I won’t get them 
straight for a long time. 

LOUISA: My name is Marta 

MARTA: It is not. My name's Marta. She’s Louisa. 

(ELSA and the children have disappeared.) 

CAPTAIN: (Going to MARIA) You were right. I don’t know 
my own children, 

MARIA: They're waiting to know you. They want so much to

FRAU SCHMIDT: Oh, yes, there used to be lots of parties 

here. 

LIESL: Friedrich and I used to sneak out and watch them 

from the top of the stairs

shoulders) Yes, Louisa. 

BRITITTA: Can we dance while the guests are dancing? 

LIESL: Yes, of course. Remember what Fraulein Maria 
told us. 

CHILDREN: Yes. 

(KURT and BRIGITTA waltz together. So do LOUISA

to dance; she pretends surprise, then curtsies and extends 
her arms. Slowly she begins to waltz and is dancing gaily 
when the travellers part.) 


ACT! 
Scene 11 


The living room of the Trapp villa. The room is filled 
with waltzing couples, whom the children join briefly, then 
exit, except for BRIGITTA. BARONESS ELBERFELD is 
seated on the sofa, which has been pushed back. There are 
two men not dancing, BARON ELBERFELD and HERR 
ZELLER. They are obviously in a spirited argument. One 
couple stops dancing and goes to them as if to intervene. 
As the dance music ends we hear the angry voices of the 
two men. 

ZELLER: You have German blood, haven’t you? 
ELBERFELD: I am not a Geman. I’m an Austrian, 


Jeu 


ZELLER: There’s going to be Anschluss, warn you and 
everyone like you-and that goes for our— 

FRAU ZELLER: Shhbh. 

CAPTAIN: (Entering through the French windows and 
sensing @ situation) It’s much more pleasant on the ter- 
race. (The guests, uneasy, start out onto the terrace.) 
Elberfeld, it’s very nice to have you and the Baroness 
here again. 

BARONESS ELBERFELD: Frau Schraeder’s charming, 
Georg. 

ELBERFELD: | hope she isn’t ill. 

(FRANZ enters with a glass of brandy on a tray. He 
goes to the CAPTAIN.) 

CAPTAIN: Oh, no—just a headache. (He takes the brandy 
from FRANZ.) I'm on my way up to get her. We'll find 
you on the terrace. 

(The ELBERFELDS exit. The CAPTAIN starts up- 
stairs.) 

BRIGITTA: (4¢ foot of steps) Father, I don't think these 
people are having a very good time. 

CAPTAIN: Half the people I invited aren’t speaking to the 
other half. 

BRIGITTA: Well, Father, maybe they’re having a good time 
not speaking to each other. 

(The CAPTAIN smiles and continues up stairs.) 
FRAU SCHMIDT: (Entering on balcony) Oh, sir, Frau 

Schraeder asked me to let you know that she will join 
you in a few minutes. 

CAPTAIN: Thank you. You might see whether she would 
like this glass of brandy. 

(FRAU SCHMIDT exits. KURT and MARIA enter from 
the terrace where we can see the guests dancing the Laend- 
ler, an Austrian folk dance.) 

MARIA: Kutt, I haven't danced the Laendler since I was a 
little girl 


-57- 


KURT: Oh, you remember it — show me— 
MARIA: No, I haven't danced since — 

(The CAPTAIN has paused on the balcony and f 
watches them.) 

KURT: Come, you said the left hand behind the back — 
MARIA: Yes, that’s right. But first the boy and girl meet. 
KURT: Yes. (He bows. She curtsies.) 

MARIA: Then they go for a little stroll 

(They join hands and cross the stage in a folk-dance 
step, to the music coming from the terrace. When they reach 
the foot of the stairs they try to execute a movement which 
is a little awkward for KURT.) 

CAPTAIN: No, that’s wrong, Kurt. Let me show you, 

(He hurries down the stairs He takes MARIA’s hand and 
they continue the dance as KURT and BRITITTA watch 
them. The dance reaches the point at which MARIA and the 
CAPTAIN, while holding hands, must execute a figure which 
calls for MARIA to turn under the CAPTAIN’s arms and as- 
sume a position in which his arms are around her and his 
face close to hers. This physical embrace brings an aware 
ness to both of them. When this same figure is repeated 
MARIA finds herself under the spell of an emotion that she 
has never experienced before and does not understand. In 
self-consciousness she breaks away.) 

MARIA: I-I don’t remember—any more. 
CAPTAIN: (Also self-conscious) Well, Kurt—that’s the way 
it’s done. 

(The music comes to an end. The CAPTAIN exits to the 
terrace, as ELSA enters from R. onto the balcony. She 
watches the CAPTAIN disappear, then looks with interest 
at MARIA.) 

BRIGITTA: (Crossing to MARIA) Your face is all red. 

MARIA: I guess I’m not very used to dancing. 

ELSA: Well, hello there, 

MARIA: Good evening, Frau Schraeder. (She exits DR. 
ELSA comes down the stairs.)

KURT: I hope you're feeling better, Frau Schraeder. 

ELSA: Yes, thank you, Kurt. 

(KURT exits D.L. MAX and FRANZ enter through the 
front door. MAX is wearing a topcoat. FRANZ is carrying 
his bag. MAX puts his hands over BRIGITTA’s eyes.) 
BRIGITTA: Hello, Uncle Max, we're having a party. 

(FRANZ exits upstairs carrying MAX’s suitcase) 
MAX: Good. Tell your father it’s sure to be a success. I’m 

here, 

(BRIGITTA exits to terrace.) 

ELSA: (At foot of stairs) Max! 

MAX; (R.C.) Elsa! Without a doubt you're the most beauti- 
ful corporation president in the entire world. (Kisses 
her hand.) 

ELSA: Thank you, Max. 

CAPTAIN: (Entering from trrrace with LIESL. Crosses to 
L. of MAX) Max—you’re back. And as usual just in time 
for dinner. 

MAX: Georg, did you think you could give a gala without me? 

CAPTAIN: Oh, dear, now we have an odd man. 

MAX: (Indignantly) A little odd, but charming, 

CAPTAIN: Liesl, run and ask Frau Schmidt to set two more 
places and I want to see Fraulein Maria. 

(LIESL exits D.R.) 

ELSA: (Crosses below MAX and CAPTAIN to L.C.) Two 
places? 

CAPTAIN: We need another woman. 

ELSA: Who? Liesl? 

CAPTAIN: Oh, no—she’s much too young. I’ll ask Maria. 

MAX: You're not serious? 

CAPTAIN: But of course! 

MAX: She’s a nursemaid. 

CAPTAIN: I don’t think of her that way. 

MAX: I don’t mind, but your friends—you can’t ask them to 
dine with Maria, 


=55= 


CAPTAIN: Why not? 

MAX: Elsa, tell him why not. 

ELSA: Max, can you change in a hurry? 

CAPTAIN: Yes, Max, we can use you tonight. 

(MAX starts up stairs. ) 

BRIGITTA: (Entering from terrace, crosses to LC.) Frau 
Schraeder, they’re talking about you out there 

ELSA: Come on, Georg, I’ve been dodging these people for 
an hour. (ELSA and CAPTAIN exit to terrace.) 

MARIA: (Entering D.R.} Brigitta, have you seen your father? 

MAX: (On balcony) Good evening, Fraulein Maria 

MARIA: Herr Detweiler, it’s nice to see you again 

MAX: Yes, you're going to. (Exits off R.) 

BRIGITTA: (D.R.C.) | knew it all along. Frau Schraeder 
didn’t have a headache. She just wanted to get out of 
the party. She was faking. 

MARIA: (Crosses to BRIGITTA) Brigitta, you shouldn’t 
say things you don’t know are true. 

BRIGITTA: But I do know. | heard her say to Father she'd 
been dodging these people. 

MARIA: That doesn’t mean that she didn’t have a headache: 
It’s very important that you children like Frau Schraeder. 

BRIGITTA: | like her all right. Why is it important? 

MARIA: Well-I think she’s going to be your new mother. 

BRIGITTA: Oh, Fraulein, Father’s never going to marry 
her. Why, he couldn’t. 

MARIA: Why couldn’t he? 

BRIGITTA: Because he’s in love with you. 

MARIA: Now Brigitta, that’s just the kind of thing— 

BRIGITTA: You must know that— 

MARIA: Brigitta—no! 

BRIGITTA: Remember the other night when we were all 
sitting on the floor singing the Edelweiss song he taught 
us? After we finished, you laughted at him for forgetting 


~60-. 


the words, He didn’t forget the words, He just stopped 
singing to look at you. And when he speaks to you, the 
way his voice sounds— 

(MARIA can’t accept an idea that conflicts with her 
commitment to the church.) 

MARIA: No, Brigitta, no. 
BRIGITTA: And the way you looked at him just now when 
you were dancing. You're in love with him. 

(MARIA stands in stunned silence, The CAPTAIN en- 
ters fram the terrace with GRETL, LOUISA and KURT.) 
CAPTAIN: One more dance. Gretl, and then to bed. (He 

sees MARIA and goes to her.) Oh, Fraulein Maria, you’re 
not going to have dinner with the children tonight. You're 
having dinner down here with us. (MARIA shakes her 
head—‘‘No! I can’t!”?) Oh, yes! It’s all arranged. You'll 
have to hurry. You'll have to change. (She starts up the 
Stairs but stops as the CAPTAIN speaks.) Oh, and Matia, 
wear the dress you wore the other night-when we were 
all singing.—It was lovely—soft and white. 

(MARIA stares at him for a moment then quickly exits 
upstairs. FRANZ enters from the dining room D.L.) 
FRANZ; Shall I announce dinner, Captain? 

* ELSA: (Entering from terrace, followed by the guests) Oh, 
no, not yet, The children will want to say good night. 
Oh.Georg, I wanted the children to say good night the 
way they did last night. 

CAPTAIN: No, Elsa—not here— 

ELSA: Please, Georg, the way they did it for me-it was so 
sweet. 

CAPTAIN: No, no, not in front of strangers! 

ELSA: Please, Georg, for me. 

MAX: (Entering on the balcony in evening clothes) Presto 
chango! 

ELSA: Max, you're just in time, Children—now. 


=6ie 


(MAX comes down the steps and joins ELSA and the 
CAPTAIN. The children line up near the stairs. The guests 
assemble at the opposite side of the room.) 

CHILDREN: (Singing) 
There’s a sad sort of clanging 
From the clock in the hall 
And the bells in the steeple, too, 
And up in the nursery an absurd little bird 


Is popping out to say “coo-coo. 
Regretfully they tell us 
But firmly they compel us 
To say “goodbye” to you 
So long, farewell 
Auf wiedersehen, good night 
MARTA: (Steps forward) 
Thate to go and leave this pretty sight. 
(MARTA exits D.R.) — (Musical interlude.) 
CHILDREN: So long, farewell, 
‘Auf Wiedersehen, adieu. 
KURT: (Steps forward) 
Adieu, adieu, 
To yieu, and yieu, and yieu (Exits.) 
CHILDREN: So long, farewell, 
Au’voir, auf wiedersehea 
LIESL: (Steps forward) 
I'd like to stay and taste my first champagne. 
(To the CAPTAIN—speaking) No? 
CAPTAIN: (Speaking) No! (LIESL exits. Interlude) 
CHILDREN: (Singing) 
So long, farewell, 
Auf wiedersehen, goodbye. 
FRIEDRICH: (Steps forward) 
I leave and heave a sigh and say goodbye 


Goodbye!

(KURT exits.) 
BRIGITTA: I’m glad to go, I cannot tell a lie 
(FRIEDRICH exits.) 
LOUISA 1 flit, I float, I fleetly flee, T fly 
(BRIGIITA and LOUISA exit together.) 
GRETL: (Sitting on the bottom stair) 
The sun has gone to bed and so must I 
(Still sitting she backs halfway up the steps one at a 
time.) 
CHILDREN: (Having re-entered on the balcony) 
So long, farewell, auf wiedersehen, goodbye 
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye. 
(LIESL goes down the steps to GRETL, takes her in 
her arms and exits with the others.) 
GUESTS: (singing) 
Goodbye 
(FRANZ announces dinner and the CAPTAIN and the 
guests drift off to the dining room L. MAX, excited, goes 
to ELSA.) 
MAX: Elsa, they’re extraordinary! 
ELSA: Fraulein Maria taught them to do it. 
MAX: L’ve been looking all over Austria for something like 
this for the Festival and I find it here. 
ELSA: Wait a minute, Max 
MAX: A singing group of seven children in one family. 
ELSA: Max! Georg didn’t even want them to sing in front 
of the guests tonight. I had to persuade him. 
MAX: Ah, then you have influence, You must talk to him 
ELSA: Max! 
MAX: Elsa! This is important to Austria. And it wouldn’t 
do me any harm. 
(They exit into the dining room. The music segues into 
a slow, soft version of “The Lonely Goatherd.” We see 
MARIA come down from the third floor onto the balcony. She 


~63- 


is wearing the hat and dress she wore the day she first 
came to the villa and she is carrying her guitar case and 
bag. She makes sure the living room is empty. She comes 
slowly down the stairs. She looks unhappily toward the 
dining room as though she wanted to say goodbye to some- 
one. She looks longingly upstairs where the children have 
gone off. She takes a last farewell look around the room, 
then slowly and sadly exits to the outer corridor.)

A corridor in the Abbey. SISTER SOPHIA enters, ac- 
companied by a young girl carrying a small traveling bag. 
She is distinctively and attractively dressed. (She is a new 
POSTULANT.) They start down the corridor. From the op- 
posite side six nuns enter in double file, chanting. 

NUNS: Rex admirabilis et triumphator nobis 
Dulcedo ineffabilis totus desiderabilis 
Totus desiderabilis.

they go down the corridor and disappear. Then they exit.)

Scene 13 


The office of the MOTHER ABBESS, The MOTHER 
ABBESS is seated at her desk and SISTER SOPHIA stands 
facing her. The new POSTULANT is R. of the desk, sign- 
ing her name to @ paper. 

MOTHER ABBESS: (Rising) Sister Sophia, take our new 
postulant to the robing room. Bless you, my daughter.

(The POSTULANT kneels. The MOTHER ABBESS 
blesses her. There is a knock on the door U.R.) Ave! 
(SISTER MARGARETTA enters U.R. SISTER SOPHIA 

and the new POSTULANT exit U.R.) 

MARGARETTA: Maria has asked to see you. I know it has 
taken her a long time. 

MOTHER ABBESS: I waited until she wanted to come to me. 

MARGARETTA: It's strange. She’s happy to be here—but 
she’s unhappy, too 

MOTHER ABBESS: Why did they send her back—do you 
know? 

MARGARETTA: She doesn’t speak. She hasn't spoken ex- 
cept in prayer 

MOTHER ABBESS: I shall see her. 

MARGARETTA: (Crosses to the door) Maria. 

(MARIA enters, goes to the MOTHER ABBESS and 

kneels.) 

MOTHER ABBESS: (Blessing MARIA) This must have 
been a trying experience for you. 

MARIA: It was, Reverend Mother. 

MOTHER ABBESS; Has it taught you anything? 

MARIA: I’ve learned that I never want to leave these walls 
again. 

MOTHER ABBESS: Why did they send you back to us? 
MARIA: (After a moment's hesitation) They didn’t send me 
back. I left. I left without telling them I was going, 

without saying goodbye. 

MOTHER ABBESS: Sit down, Maria. (MARIA sits by the 
desk.) Maria, what happened? Why did you do this? 

MARIA: I was frightened. 

MOTHER ABBESS: Frightened? 

MARIA: (With difficulty) I was confused, I felt—I never felt 
that way before. I couldn’t stay—and I knew that here I 
would be away from it—that here I would be safe. 


~68— 


MOTHER ABBESS: Maria, our abbey is not to be used as an 
escape. What is it you can’t face? 

MARIA: I can’t face him again. 

MOTHER ABBESS: (After a pause) Thank you, Sister Mar 
garetta. (SISTER MARGARETTA exits U.R. The MOTHEL 
ABBESS stands behind MARIA. She puts her hands on 
MARIA’s shoulders and speaks quietly.) Maria, are you in 
love with Captain von Trapp? 

MARIA: (Torn) I don’t know. I don’t know. 

MOTHER ABBESS: Tell me about it, my child. 

MARIA: (ith emotion) Brigitta said that | was—and that her 
father was in love with me—and then there he was—and 
we were looking at each other—and I could hardly breathe 
Then I knew I couldn’t stay. (She rises.) 

MOTHER ABBESS: But you do like him, Maria? 

MARIA: Oh, yes! 

MOTHER ABBESS: Did you let him see how you felt? 

MARIA: (Turning to her) If | did I didn't know that | did. 
That’s what's been torturing me: I was thete on God’s 
errand, To have asked for the Captain’s love would have 
been wrong. I don't know, Mother. 1 do know this— (She 
kneels before the MOTHER ABBESS.) | am ready at this 
very moment to take the vows of poverty, obedience and 
—chastity. 

MOTHER ABBESS: (Helping MARIA to rise) Matia, the love 
of aman and a woman is holy, too. The first time we 
talked together-you told me that you remembered your 
father and mother before they died. Do you remember— 
were they happy? (She seats MARIA on the stool.) 

MARIA: Oh, yes, Mother, they were very happy. 

MOTHER ABBESS: Maria, you were born of their happiness, 
of their love. And, my child, you have a great capacity 
to love. What you must find out is—how does God want 
you to spend your love. (The MOTHER ABBESS sits at 
her desk.) 


—66- 


MARIA: I’ve pledged my life to God’s service. I’ve pledged 
my life to God. 

MOTHER ABBESS: My daughter, if you love this man, it 
doesn’t mean that you love God less, You must find out. 
You must go back 

MARIA: (Rising) Oh, no, Mother, please, don’t ask me to do 
that. Please! Let me stay here. (MARIA circles behind 
the desk and sinks at the feet of the MOTHER ABBESS. 

MOTHER ABBESS: These walls were not made to shut out 
problems, You have to face them, You have to find the 
life you were born to live. 

MARIA: How do I find it? 

MOTHER ABBESS: Look for it. (Her arm around MARIA. 
She sings.) Climb every mountain 

Search high and low 
Follow every byway 
Every path you know. 


Climb every mountain 
Ford every stream 
Follow every rainbow 
Till you find your dream. 


A dream that will need all the love you can 
give 
Every day of your life for as long as you 
live. 
(The MOTHER ABBESS rises.) 
Climb every mountain 
Ford every stream 
Follow every rainbow 
Till you find your dream. 
‘A dream that will need all the love you can 
give 
(She lifes MARIA to her feet.)

Every day of your life for as long as you live 
(The MOTHER ABBESS crosses R.) 


Climb every mountain 
Ford every stream 
Follow every rainbow 


Till you find your dream,

postulant’s veil from her head and stands transfixed.)

ACT IL 
Scene I 


The terrace. CAPTAIN’ s guitar is on coffee table. 
Ent? acte continues into scene and song. MAX, blindfolded, 
and the children are playing blind man’s bluff and singing 
“The Lonely Goatherd.”” FRIEDRICH is standing on a 
chair, MARTA is standing on @ bench, BRIGITTA (at first) 
is sitting on the stool reading, then joins in game. 

MAX: (Singing) One little girl in a pale pink coat heard 


MARTA: Layee odl, layee od layee 0 
KURT: She yodeled back to the lonely goatherd 
LOUISA: Layee odl, layee odl 0 

ALL: Soon her Mama with a gleaming gloat heard 
MAX: Layee odl, layee od! layee 0 


GRETL: (Teases MAX by poking him with guitar) 
What a duet for a girl and goatherd 
(LIESL pulls off MAX’s blindfold, then takes guitar 
from GRETL.) 
MAX: (Strutting L.C.) 
Layee odl, layee odl o 
ALL: (Mimicking MAX) 
O ho, layee od! lee o~ 
(MAX stops the singing.) 
MAX: Enough. Now sing seriously. Liesl, give us a key. 
(He conducts. LIESL strikes a note. Children are in 

a vague line up R. stage very informally.) 

ALL: (Singing) Do-~me—so—do. 

MAX: (Gives conductor cut-off. Speaking) That’s nice—very 
nice—except it’s no good. Imagine that you're standing 
on the stage of a big concert hall 

LOUISA: What concert hall, Uncle Max? 

MAX: Any concert hall—maybe Kaltzberg Concert Hall—but 
a concert hall full of people. Now, once more. 


-69- 


ALL: (Singing) Do—me—so—do. 
(MAX stops them individually, GRETL, who is sitting 
on the terrace step, last.) 

MAX: Gretl, why don’t you sing loud? 

GRETL: I've got a sore finger. (She holds up a bandaged 

finger.) 

MAX: (Kissing her finger) Now you can sing loud for Uncle 
Max. The night of the party you sang so beautifully— 
with such spirit. Well—let’s try again. (He gives them a 
downbeat. They hit a chord. The CAPTAIN and ELSA 
enter from the garden. MAX sees them and stops the 
singing.) They wanted to sing for me, the darlings, but 
they don’t sing as well as they used to. 

LOUISA: We need Fraulein Maria. 

CAPTAIN: (Taking the guitar from LIESL) We do not need 
Fraulein Maria, You can sing just as well with me. 

MAX: But I’ve had experience with choirs, quartets, glee 
clubs— 

CAPTAIN: Max, please~ (To the children.) Now what 
would you like to sing? (singing.) 

Doe, a deer, a female deer— 

KURT: Fraulein Maria always started with— 

CAPTAIN: We are not to mention Fraulein Mars— 

ELSA: (Sensing something) Come on, Max, | feel like a 
brisk walk. 

MAX: That’s just what I need— (He follows her, turns.) 

Is anyone using the car? (MAX and ELSA exit U.L.) 

CAPTAIN: Now, what are you going to sing? 

(LIESL starts and conducts the children in:) 

CHILDREN: (Singing) 

The hills are alive 
With the sound of music 
(The CAPTAIN joins the singing.) 


-70- 


With songs they have sung 
For a thousand years 
(The CAPTAIN stops.) 

CAPTAIN: No, not that— (Leading LOUISA aside.) Louisa, 
did you play any of your tricks—any of your jokes—on 
Fraulein Maria? 

LOUISA: Only those she liked and laughed at 

CAPTAIN: You didn't put toads in her bed? 

LOUISA: No, Father. 

CAPTAIN: Well, something must have happened—for her to 
leave us without even saying goodbye 

GRETL: Isn’t Fraulein Maria coming back? 

CAPTAIN: No, darling. 1 don’t think so. 

MARTA: But she was the best governess we ever had. 

CAPTAIN: You're not going to have a governess any 
more. 

LOUISA: Oh, good! 

KURT: I’m not sure that’s good. 

CAPTAIN: You’re going to have a new mother. 

LIESL: A new mother? 

FRIEDRICH: Frau Schraeder? 

CAPTAIN: (Hands LIESL the guitar) Yes. It was all settled 
last night. I’m very happy. Well, it’s time for your after- 
noon walk. (LIESL kisses him. He exits into the house.) 

LOUISA: (At stool) When Fraulein Maria wanted to feel 
better, she used to sing that song-remember? 

LIESL: (Putting guitar on coffee table) Yes. 

BRIGITTA: (L. of coffee table) All right. Let’s try it 

ALL: (Wandering listlessly. singing) 

Raindrops on roses 

And whiskers on kittens 
Bright copper kettles 
And warm woolen mittens 
Brown paper packages— 


-71- 


(ORCHESTRA joins in.) 

Tied up with strings 

These are a few of 

My favorite things 
GRETL: (D.C.) Why don’t I feel better? 

(Children start to sing but drop out one by one as they 

hear MARIA offstage.) 
MARIA: (Offstage) 
Girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes, 
Snowflakes that stay on my nose and 
eyelashes, 
Silver-white winters that melt into springs 
These are a few of my favorite things. 
CHILDREN: Maria!—Maria’s back! 

(They run to meet her as she enters U.L. She is wear 
ing the suit and hat we saw the new POSTULANT wear. 
FRIEDRICH takes her guitar and sets it above the stool. 
KURT takes suitcase and drops it back of stool.) 

MARIA and CHILDREN: (Singing) 
When the dog bites, when the bee stings, 
When I’m feeling sad 
I simply remember my favorite things, 
And then I don't feel so bad. 

(FRIEDRICH arranges guitar and suitcase.) 

MARIA: (Hugging them C.S.) Children, children, I’m so 
happy to see you. I must find your father right away. 

MARTA: I’ll find him. (She runs into the house.) 

KURT: I'll go with you. (He follows MARTA into the house.) 

MARIA: (To GRETL) How's your sore finger? 

GRETL: You remembered! 

MARIA: Liesl—are you all right? 

LIESL: (Soberly) Yes, Fraulein, I’m all right. 

MARIA: Many telegrams lately? 

LIESL: No, Fraulein, Now I'll be glad to go to boarding 
school. 


~72- 


MARIA: Liesl, you can’t use boarding school to escape 
your problems. You have to face them. (Embraces 
LIESL.) Oh, T have so much to talk to you about 

LOUISA; We have some things to tell you, too. 

MARIA: You must have a great deal to tell me. 

BRIGITTA: I guess the most important thing is that 
Father’s going to be married. 

MARIA: Married? 

LOUISA: To Frau Schraeder. 

MARIA: Are you sure? 

BRIGITTA: Oh, yes, he just told us-he told us himself 

(KURT and MARTA enter from house.) 

KURT: We found him. 

(CAPTAIN enters from house.) 

CAPTAIN: Liesl— 

LIESL: Louisa, Brigitta, boys! Maria, we'll be in the 
nursery. (Children exit into house. } 

CAPTAIN; You've come back? 

MARIA: Yes, Captain. 

CAPTAIN: You left us without any explanation whatsoever 
—without even saying goodbye. 

MARIA: It was very wrong of me. Forgive me. 

CAPTAIN: Why did you do this to us? Tell me. 

MARIA: Please don’t ask me, Anyway, the reason no longer 
exists. (Crosses and picks up guitar case and carpet bag,) 

CAPTAIN: Then you're back to stay? 

MARIA; Only until you can make arrangements for another 
governess 

CAPTAIN: Oh, no! You've been missed by the children, 
I've missed—everybody missed you very much. Nothing 
was the same while you were away. Everything was 
wrong. 

MARIA: But I— 


-73= 


CAPTAIN: We'll talk about it later. You go up to the 
children now. (MARIA starts toward house.) Maria, a 
new dress? 

MARIA: We have a new postulant. (She exits into the 
house. CAPTAIN sits L. of coffee table, strumming 
guitar.) 

ELSA: (Entering from garden) 1 know I’m right, Max 
We'll find him and ask him. 

MAX: (Following her on and crossing C.) I'll take your 
word for it, Elsa. 

ELSA: Georg, settle this for Max and me, will you. How 
far down the mountain does your property go? 

CAPTAIN: Can you make out that stone wall? That's the 
property line. 

ELSA: (Turning to MAX) You see. 

MAX: (Sits on bench L.)I didn’t argue about it 

ELSA: I know, that makes me furious. I don’t like to win 
without a fight. 

FRANZ: (FRANZ enters from the house) Herr Detweiler, while 
you were gone, you had along distance call from Berlin. 

MAX: (Innocently) Who could be calling me from Berlin? 

FRANZ: They said you’d know who it was, 

MAX: Oh’. Thank you, Franz. (FRANZ exits to the house.) 
Georg, what were we just talking abont? 

CAPTAIN: Max, this isn’t the first call you've had from 
Berlin. 

MAX: Georg, you know I have no political convictions. Can 
T help it if other people have? 

ELSA: Let’s not stir that up again, The Germans have 
promised not to invade Austria. (Crosses to R. of coffee 
table.) Max knows that. 

CAPTAIN: Then why does he bother to answer those calls 
from Berlin? 

MAX: Because if they don’t keep their promise, I want to 
have some friends among them. 


=74- 


ELSA: Naturally. 

CAPTAIN: Oh, you agree, too? 

MAX: (Rises, crosses to CAPTAIN) Georg, this is the way 
T look at it. There was a man who was dying. They were 
giving him the last rites. They asked him, “Do you re- 
nounce the devil and all his works?” and he said, “At 
this moment, I prefer not to make any enemies.” 
(Crosses L, CAPTAIN strums his guitar.) 

ELSA: Georg-if they—if they should invade us—would you 
defy them? 

CAPTAIN: . . . Yes. 

MAX: (Crosses to CAPTAIN) Do you tealize what might 
happen to you? To your property? 

ELSA: To your children? 

MAX: To everyone close to you. . . to Elsa. . . to me! 

CAPTAIN: (Rises, crosses D.R.) Well, what will you do 
if they come? 

MAX: (Takes chair L. of coffee table, places it D.C. and 
sits) What anyone with any sense would do—just sit 
tight and wait for it all to blow over. 

CAPTAIN: And you think it will? 

MAX: One thing is sure—nothing you can do will make any 
difference. (Rises, crosses L.C.) 

ELSA: (Crosses above D.C. chair, pushing CAPTAIN on 
to chair) Don’t look so serious, darling. Take the world 
off your shoulders. Relax. 

ELSA: (Above CAPTAIN) 

You dear attractive dewy-eyed idealist, 
Today you have to leam to bea realist. 
MAX: You may be bent on doing deeds of derring-do 
But up against a shark what can a herring do? 
ELSA: (Moves to MAX, L. of CAPTAIN) 
Be wise, compromise! 
CAPTAIN: Compromise, and be wise! 


-75- 


ELSA: Let them think you’re on their side, be non- 


committal 
CAPTAIN: I will not bow my head to the men I despise. 
MAX: You won't have to bow your head, just 


stoop a little, 
(He stoops a little.) 
ELSA: (Moving behind CAPTAIN) 
Why not leam to put your faith and your 
reliance 
On an obvious and simple fact of science? 
(ELSA crosses R.) 
A crazy planet full of crazy people 
Is somersaulting all around the sky, 
And every time it turns another somersault, 
Another day goes by! 


And there's no way to stop it, 
No, there’s no way to stop it, 
(Crosses to CAPTAIN.) 
No, you can’t stop it even if you try. 
So I’m not going to worry, 
No, I'm not going to worry, 
Every time I see another day go by. 

(MAX crosses U.S. and back D.S., stopping CAPTAIN 
from playing guitar by putting his hands over the strings. 
ELSA goes to U. stage chair.) 

MAX While somersaulting at a cock-eyed angle, 
We make a cock-eyed circle around the sun. 

(Circle around CAPTAIN.) 

‘And when we circle back to where we 
started from, 
Another year has run. 

(CAPTAIN hits chord on guitar, crosses S.L.) 

MAX and ELSA: 
And there’s no way to stop it, 


~76- 


No, there’s no way to stop it 
If the earth wants to roll around the sun! 
You're a fool if you worry 
(MAX crosses SL.) 
You're a fool if you worry 
(CAPTAIN turns to ELSA.) 
Over anything but little Number One! 
CAPTAIN: That’s you! 
ELSA: (Indicating herself) 
That's 1. 
MAX: (Indicating himself) 
And 
CAPTAIN: And me! 
That all-absorbing character! 
ELSA: (Steps in front of CAPTAIN) 
That fascinating creaturet 
MAX: (Steps in front of ELSA) 
That super-special feature— 
ALL: (MAX and ELSA separate-CAPTAIN sits on stool) 
Me! 
CAPTAIN: So every star and every whirling planet, 
And every constellation in the sky 
Revolve around the center of theuniverse, 
A lovely thing called I! 
(Spreads arms, guitar in right hand—MAX takes 
guitar. CAPTAIN rises.) 
ALL: ‘And there's no way to stop it, 
(MAX points guitar at CAPTAIN.) 
No, there’s no way to stop it, 
And I know though I cannot tell you why. 
CAPTAIN: (Speaks) That's charming! 
ALL: That as long as I’m living, 
Just as long as I’m living, 
There'll be nothing else as wonderful as

ELSA if 
ALL: bog 
(MAX pretends to strum the back of the guitar. The 

CAPTAIN grabs it and plays, one foot on chair D.C., 

crossing to chair D.S. ELSA starts to follow but is stopped 

by MAX.) —_ Nothing else as wonderful as T 

CAPTAIN: (Putting chair back L. of table) I! Me! On one 
thing alone we agree. , . each one is important to him- 
self... but you can’t save yourself by giving up, and 
you don’t outwit a lion by putting your head— 

FRANZ: (Entering from house, addressing MAX) Your call 
from Berlin, sir. 

CAPTAIN: (Pointing to FRANZ) —in the lion’s mouth. 

MAX: (After a hesitation) I'll call them back— 

ELSA: (L. of MAX, quietly) You might as well talk to 
them now, Max. 

CAPTAIN: Go, go, go. 

(MAX exits into house followed by FRANZ.) 

ELSA: (After a pause) Georg-I feel | know what’s going to 
happen here. Can’t you see things my way? 

CAPTAIN; No=not if you’re willing to see things their way 
ELSA: (Crosses D.L. before she speaks) There’s one thing 
you do better here than we do in Vienna—your sunsets 

I'm going to miss them. 

MARIA: (Entering from house) Captain— Oh, I beg your 
pardon 

ELSA: Maria! Georg, you didn’t tell me Fraulein Maria was 
back. I’m delighted. 

MARIA: (D.R.) Thank you. Captain, the children would like 
to know if they could take a holiday from their lessons 
tomorrow so that we can go on a picnic. 

CAPTAIN: Yes, I don’t mind. 

MARIA: That will make them very happy. And may I be per- 
mitted to wish you happiness too, Frau Schraeder— 


~78- 


Captain. The children have told me that you're going 
to be married. 

ELSA: Ob? I’m afraid the children were wrong. (Crosses 
C. ta CAPTAIN who stands.) Georg, I've got to finish 
my packing if I’m to get back to Vienna 

CAPTAIN: If you feel you must. Ill tell Franz to have the 
car ready 

ELSA: I can do that. (As he kisses her hand she drops his 
engagement ring into his hand.) Auf Wiedersehen, Georg. 
Goodbye, Maria. (She exits into the house. CAPTAIN 
walks U.C.) 

MARIA: I'm sorry if I said something I shouldn't have said 

CAPTAIN: You did say the wrong thing—but you said it at 
the right time. 

MARIA: The children told me that you were going to marry 
Frau Schraeder. 

CAPTAIN: (Crosses D.C.) We found we just couldn't go 
the same way. That door is shut. 

MARIA: Sister Margaretta always says, “When God shuts 
a door—” 

CAPTAIN: I know—“He opens a window.” Maria, why did 
you run away to the Abbey?. . . What made you come 
back? 

MARIA: The Mother Abbess—she said that you have to 
look for your life. 

CAPTAIN: Often when you find it, you don’t recognize it, 

MARIA: No. 

CAPTAIN: Not at first. Then one day—one night—all of a 
sudden, it stands before you. 

MARIA: Yes. 

CAPTAIN: (Crosses to MARIA) 1 look at you now, and I 
realize this is not something that has just happened. 

It is something ’ve known—deep inside me—for many 
weeks. . . You knew it, too! (She nods.) What was it 
that told you? 


~79- 


MARIA: (Crossing L. to CAPTAIN) Brigitta. She said— 
when we were dancing—that night— 
CAPTAIN: She was quite right. That was not just an 
ordinary dance, was it? 
MARIA; I hadn't danced since I was a very little girl. It’s 
quite different after you're grown up, isn’t it? 
CAPTAIN: When you were a very little girl, did a very little 
boy ever kiss you? 
MARIA: Uh-huh 
CAPTAIN: ‘That's quite different, too. 
MARIA: Is it? (They kiss.) It is different 
CAPTAIN: Your whole life will be different now, Maria 
I'll take you anywhere you want to go-give you any- 
thing you wish 
MARIA: But I don’t want to go anywhere. All I could wish 
for is right here. (MARIA moves S.L. of CAPTAIN. 
Standing, sings.) 
‘An ordinary couple 
Is all we’ll ever be, 
For all I want of living 
Is to keep you close to me,

to bench—back to the CAPTAIN. CAPTAIN and MARIA 
cross D.C.)

together sometime. 
MARIA: Who? (Looking at CAPTAIN.)

drop is lowered suggesting the dome of a chapel. MARIA 
makes a gesture of farewell to the MOTHER ABBESS, The 
nuns line up behind the grille to watch the march to the 
altar and a ceremony of which they cannot be a part. The 
VON TRAPP girls enter D.R. dressed for the wedding and

ding march starts. The wedding procession moves to its 
solemn rhythm. Against the wedding march the nuns sing 


in counterpoint. 
NUNS: (Singing) 

How do you solve a problem like Maria? 

‘How do you catch a cloud and pin it down? 

How do you find a word that means Maria? 

A flibbertijibbet, a will-o’-the-wisp, a clown! 

Many a thing you know you'd like to tell her, 

Many a thing she ought to understand, 

But how do you make her stay 

And listen to all you say? 

How do you keep a wave upon the sand? 

How do you solve a problem like Maria? 

How do you hold a moonbeam in your hand? 

(During the above chorus the girls and MARIA are 

crossing the stage. Just before they reach C., they stop. 
GRETL turns, curtseys to MARIA and hands her the bou- 
quet of roses. KURT leaves her side and stands with his 
back to the grille, where he joins FRIEDRICH. The CAP-

The living room. As the curtains part, MAX enters the 
balcony with some printed programs in his hand. 
MAX: (Coming down the stairs) Children, children! Lies!, 
Friedrich, Gretl, Kurt, Marta. . . See! Kaltzberg Festival,

Marta and Gretl. 

GRETL: Why am I always last? 

LIESL: Because you're the youngest 

MAX: Liesl, I'm depending on you. Day after tomorrow you 
must all be ready at 11 o’clock in the moming. That's 
when— (FRAU SCHMIDT enters from the terrace.) 

FRAU SCHMIDT: Hem Detweiler, can you help me, please? 
The Gauleiter is here. He wants to know why we aren’t 
flying the new flag. 

(HERR ZELLER enters from the terrace. Ile is in 
civilian clothes, He has no kat.) 

ZELLER: (Saluting MAX) Heil! 

FRAU SCHMIDT: | tried to explain— 

ZELLER: Keep quiet. (To MAX.) When is Captain von 
Trapp returning? 

MAX: (Crosses to ZELLER) Who knows? When a man is on 
his honeymoon— 

ZELLER: These are not times for joking! It’s been four 
days since the Anschluss. This is the only house in the 
province that is not flying the flag of the Third Reich. 

BRIGITTA: You mean the flag with the black spider on it? 

MAX: Brigitta! 

ZELLER: Do you permit such remarks in this house? Who 
are you? 

MAX: I am Maximilian Detweiler, First Secretary of the 
Ministry of Education and Culture. 

ZELLER; That was in the old regime. 

MAX: In theold regime I was Third Secretary. Now I'm 
First Secretary. 

ZELLER: Good! Then you will order them to fly the flag. 


=be- 


FRAU SCHMIDT: Captain von Trapp wouldn’t-I mean, I 
can take my orders only from Captain von Trapp. 

ZELLER: You will take your orders from us—and so will 
the Captain. (To MAX, saluting.) Heil! 

MAX: (Reluctantly Salutes) Heil! 

(ZELLER exits to terrace.) 

GRETL; Why was he so cross? 

FRAU SCHMIDT: Everybody's cross these days. (She 
exits D.R.) 

LIESL: (Crosses C. to MAX) ls Father going to be in 
trouble? 

MAX: He doesn’t have to be. The thing to do today is to 
get along with everybody. (Crosses to chair R. of 
table.) Now, Liesl, be sure you get all the children on 
the bus at 11 o’clock. (LIESL crosses to chair R. of 
sofa} 

BRIGITTA: (R. of MAX) Uncle Max, are you sure this is 
going to be all right with Father? 

MAX: He'll be pleased and proud 

BRIGITTA: Liesl, do you think so? 

MAX: (Kneeling C.) Brigitta, don’t you trust me? 

BRIGITTA: No. 

MAX: (Rising) Well, anyway, the bus leaves at 11 o’clock. 

FRANZ: (Entering U.C. with two suitcases) Fraulein 
Liesl, see what I have here. 

LIESL: That’s Father’s luggage. 

FRANZ: Yes, they're back. (He exits upstairs. BRIGITTA 
and GRETL rush out U.C.) 

MAX: (A¢ sofa) Liesl, they'll have such a lot to tell us, 
let’s not hurry about telling them anything. 

(Children enter running to front door. MARTA, LOUISA 
from D.L., KURT and FRIEDRICH from balcony.) 
CHILDREN: They’re back, they’re back! 

(CAPTAIN and MARIA enter U.C. surrounded by the 
children.) 


~87— 


MARIA: Max! 

MAX: (Below sofa) Georg, we didn’t expect you back until 
next week. 

CAPTAIN: (C.)Max, it’s good you’re here. There’s much I 
want to know, 

MARIA: (L. of CAPTAIN) Children, we missed you so very 
much 

GRETL: What did you miss most? 

MARIA: We missed all that noise you make in the morning— 

CAPTAIN: That noise you make telling each other to be 
quiet. We missed climbing upstairs to say goodnight to 
you. 

MARIA: We missed hearing you sing. 

BRIGITTA: You came back just in time to hear us sing. 
Look, Father, we're going to sing in the Kaltzberg Fes- 
tival Friday night. (She shows him a program. MAX turns 
away.) 

CAPTAIN: Let me see that. (He looks at program. Crosses 
D.C.) Max, are you responsible for this? 

MAX: (Coming to him) I've just been waiting to talk to you 
about it, Georg, 

CAPTAIN: (Crosses L.) You can't talk your way out of 
this one. 

(FRANZ and FRAU 
packages.) 
FRIEDRICH: Presents! 
CHILDREN: (Taking presents and running upstairs with 

SCHMIDT and FRANZ) Give me mine. Where's mine? 
Let’s open them in the nursery. Where’s mine? 

(They exit except for LIESL who remains on balcony. 
MARIA is taking her hat off at table R.) 

MAX: (Crosses to CAPTAIN) Now, Georg, I had to make a 
last minute decision—I was very fortunate to be able to 
enter them at all-they’ll be the talk of the Festival— 
seven children in one family— 


(MIDT enter U.C. with 


—88- 


CAPTAIN: Not my family! 

MAX: The committee heard them—they were enchanted. 

MARIA: (Crosses D.L. to MAX) Really, Max. What did they 
say? 

MAX: You never heard such praise. 

MARIA: Georg, did you hear— 

CAPTAIN: (Quietly, but firmly) The Von Trapp Family does 
not sing in public. 

MARIA: But if they make people happy— 

MAX: And for the Festival-people come from all over the 
world— 

CAPTAIN: (Crosses to steps) It is out of the question! 

MAX: Georg, it’s for Austria. 

CAPTAIN: There is no Austria. (He goes upstairs.) 

MAX: But the Anschluss happened peacetully. Let’s at 
least be grateful for that. 

CAPTAIN: Grateful? (Then, quietly.) To these swine? (He 
exits on balcony. LIESL comes downstairs.) 

MAX: (C_) Maria, he must at least pretend to work with these 
people. I admire the way he feels—but you must convince 
him, he has to compromise. 

MARIA: (Below sofa) No, Max, no. 

MAX: Maria, you must. 

MARIA: Max, I can’t ask Georg to be less than what he is. 

MAX: Then I will talk to him. If these children don’t sing 
in the Festival—well, it would be a reflection on Austria 
~and it wouldn't do me any good. (He exits up back steps 
to balcony.) 

LIESL: (Crosses to MARIA) Matia, U've always known you 
loved us children. Now I know you love Father. 

MARIA: (Sits sofa) do, Leisl. 1 love him very much 

LIESL: (Sits R. of MARIA) How can you be sure? 

MARIA: Because I don't think first of myself, any more, I 
think first of him. I know now how to spend my love. 


~89— 


(Sings. Holding LIESL’s hand.) 
A bell is no bell till you ring it, 
A song is no song till you sing it, 
And love in your heart 
Wasn’t put there to stay— 
Love isn’t love 
Till you give it away. 


When you're sixteen, going on seventeen, 
Waiting for life to start, 
Somebody kind 
Who touches your mind 
suddenly touch your heart! 
LIESL: When that happens, after it happens, 
Nothing is quite the same. 
Somehow you know 
You’ll jump up and go 
If ever he calls your name! 
MARIA: Gone are your old ideas of life, 
The old ideas grow dim— 
Lo and behold! You’re someone’s wife 
‘And you belong to him! 
You may think this kind of adventure 
(Puts arm around LIESL.) 
Never may come to you. 
Darling Sixteen-goin g-on-Seventeen, 
Wait—a year—or two. 


LIESL: Vil wait a year 
BOTH: (They embrace) 
or two! 


(FRAU SCHMIDT enters U.C.) 
FRAU SCHMIDT: There's a telegram for the Captain, 
(ROLF has followed FRAU SCHMIDT on. She exits 
D.R.) \ 
LIESL: Rolf! Rolf, I’d like you to meet my mother—my new 
mother.

MARIA: (Rising) Rolf, Iam glad to meet you finally 

ROLF: (C. Coldly)1 have a telegram for Captain von 
Trapp. (He holds it out. FRANZ enters on the balcony 
and starts downstairs. ) 

MARIA: You stay here.with Liesl. I'll take it to him, (She 
starts R., reaching for the telegram. He snatches it 
away. She stops at his R.) 

ROLF: I’m under orders to make sure the Captain gets it. 

MARIA: I think you can trust me to give it to him 

ROLF: I have my orders. 

LIESL: Silly, they’te married. (ROLF sees FRANZ.) 

ROLF: Oh, Franz This telegram is to be delivered into 
the hands of Captain von Trapp 

FRANZ: (Saluting) Heil! 

ROLF: Heil! (ROLF returns the salute and gives him the 
telegram in front of MARIA’s face. FRANZ, exits 
upstairs.) 

LIESL: (Shocked) Rolf! 

MARIA: Even Franz. 

ROLF: Yes, even Franz. Even me! Even everybody in 
Nonnberg except the great Captain von Trapp. If he 
knows what's good for him, he’ll come over to the right 
side. 

LIESL: Rolf, don’t talk like that, 

(FRANZ re-enters balcony, comes down steps.) 

ROLF: And if he doesn’t, he’d better get out of the country 
~there are things that happen today to a man like that. 
He'd better get out quick. (L/ESL runs to MARIA.) Cry 
all you want, but just remember what I said before it’s 
too late. (To MARIA.) And you remember too. (He exits 
U.C. followed by FRANZ.) > 

MARIA: Liesl—don’t cry. 

LIESL: How could he tum on Father that way? 

MARIA: Liesl—maybe he wasn’t threatening your father— 
maybe he was warning him. 


-~91-~ 


(CAPTAIN enters balcony, an open telegram in his 
hand.) 

CAPTAIN: LiesI— (LIESL, runs out D.R.) 

MARIA: What is it Georg? 

CAPTAIN: (Coming down stairs) 1 didn’t think I would 
have to face a decision this soon. Berlin has offered 
me a commission in their Navy. 

MARIA: (Crosses to him D.R.) Well, Georg? 

CAPTAIN: I can’t just brush this aside. I admit it would 
be exciting to have a ship under me again. What I mean 
is~it would be a relief and a comfort to know that you 
and the children are safe. Butit also means— Please, 
Maria, help me 

MARIA: Georg, whatever you decide, will be my decision. 

CAPTAIN: Thank you. I know now I can’t do it. 

MARIA: Of course not. 

CAPTAIN: We'll have to get out of Austria right away 

MARIA: You’ll have to leave—tonight—now. 

CAPTAIN: Not without my family. And we can’t just pick 
up and leave. They'll be watching us now. We’ll have 
to plan— (Doorbell. ) —we’ll have to have time 

(Offstage: “Heil.” FRANZ enters U.C.) 

FRANZ: Sir—Admiral von Schreiber of the Navy of the 
Thitd Reich is here to see you. 

CAPTAIN: Thank you, Franz. (FRANZ exits U.C.) They 
didn’t give us time 

MARIA: Then we'll have to make time. 

CAPTAIN: I’ll bring him in. We must be careful. (He exits 
U.C. MARIA prays, looks at Festival program in her 
hand, then runs upstairs.) 

MAX: (Entering on balcony followed by LIESL) What’s 
happening? Storm troopers! That’s what I was afraid of, 
Maria. 

MARIA: (On landing) Max, stay with Georg. I need the 


92 - 


children. Liesl, quickly, find the children. Quickly— 
(MARIA exits to third floor. MAX comes downstairs, 
LIESL exits on balcony. CAPTAIN enters U.C. with 
VON SCHREIBER and ZELLER. VON SCHREIBER is 
in the uniform of a German admiral.) 

CAPTAIN: This way, Admiral, we can talk in here. Admiral 
von Schreiber, may I present Herr Detweiler. . . Max | 
think you know Herr Zeller, Would you gentlemen care 
to sit down? 

ZELLER: (U.R.C.) We are here on business. 

VON SCHREIBER: (L.C.) Captain von Trapp, a telegram 
was sent to you three days ago 

CAPTAIN: (C)I have just received it, I’ve been away. 
I've only been home half an hour. 

MAX: Captain von Trapp has just returned from his honey- 
moon, sir. 

VON SCHREIBER: Congratulations, Captain, 

CAPTAIN: Thank you, sir. 

VON SCHREIBER: Your record in the war is very well re- 
membered by us, Captain 

CAPTAIN: It’s good to hear you say that, sir. 

ZELLER: Let’s get to the point. 

VON SCHREIBER: (To ZELLER) If you don’t mind. (To 
CAPTAIN.) In our.Navy we hold you in very high regard 
That explains why 1 am here. Having had no answer to 
our telegram, the High Command has sent me in person. 

CAPTAIN: That's very flattering, Admiral. But I’ve had no 
time to consider— 

(MARIA enters on balcony. She is carrying two Festival 
programs and is in her Concert costume.) 

VON SCHREIBER: I am hete to present you with your com- 
mission,— 

CAPTAIN: I am deeply conscious of the honor, sir, but— 

VON SCHREIBER: And your orders are to report immediately 
to the naval base at Bremerhaven. 


-93- 


MARIA: (Coming downstairs, with feigned innocence) 
Immediately? Oh, I’m afraid that would be impossible 
for you, Georg. 

CAPTAIN: (Crosses D.R.) Admiral, may | present my wife, 
the Baroness von Trapp, Admiral von Schreiber. 

VON SCHREIBER: Madame! 

MARIA: (Crosses to VON SCHREIBER) What I meant sir, is 
that we are all singing in the Kaltzberg Festival Friday 
night. (Children start entering on balcony.) You see— 
the Von Trapp Family Singers—here in the program. 

(She hands a program to VON SCHREIBER, then to 

ZELLER.) 

MAX: It’s been arranged by the Ministry of Education and 
Culture: 

VON SCHREIBER: Friday night? This is Wednesday, That’s 
only a matter of two days. It might be possible. You 
could report to Bremerhaven by Monday 

ZELLER: (Protesting) Admiral! 

VON SCHREIBER: Is there a telephone I could use? 

MAX: This way, Admiral. If there is any question, perhaps 
adding the weight of my voice~ (They exit D.L.) 

ZELLER: (To CAPTAIN) It gives here only the names of 
the children 

CAPTAIN: (Quickly) It says the Von Trapp Family Singers. 
I'm head of the Von Trapp Family. 

ZELLER: It’s hard to believe, Captain von Trapp—you 
singing in a concert. 

CAPTAIN: (Cooly) Herr Zeller, you may believe what you 
choose. 

ZELLER: (Crosses to CAPTAIN) It doesn’t say here what 
you’re going to sing. What are you going to sing, 
Captain? 

CAPTAIN: It’s your privilege to come to the concert and 
hear us. 


-94- 


ZELLER: !’d like to hear you sing now. Sing what you're 
going to sing in the concert. Sing! 
MARIA: (Singing) Do, re, mi, fa, So, la, ti— Liesl, will 
you give us a do? 
(LIESL blows a “do” on a pitch pipe.) 
MARIA and CHILDREN: (Singing to ZEL 
Doe, a deer, a female deer, 
Ray, a drop of golden sun,

You look happy to meet me. 

Blossom of snow, 

May you bloom and grow, 

Bloom and grow forever— 

Edelweiss, edelweiss, 

Bless my homeland forever. 


Edelweiss, edelweiss, 
Every moming. . 
(He is looking at MARIA intently and stops singing.)

MARIA and CHILDREN: (Singing) 
Small and white, clean and bright— 
(The CAPTAIN picks up the song again.) 
CAPTAIN: You look happy to meet me. 
Blossom of snow 
May you bloom and grow, 
Bloom and grow forever— 
Edelweiss, edelweiss, 
Bless my homeland forever. 
(MAX enters L. and addresses the applauding audience 
over the microphone.) 

MAX: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you. (The 
family starts off stage R. MAX stops them.) Just a mo- 
ment. I have an announcement that concerns you. (Into 
the microphone.) Ladies and gentlemen, the Festival 
Concert has come to its conclusion—except of course, 
we don’t know what the conclusion is going to be. The 
judges are putting their heads together to arrive at their 
decision, and while we are waiting I think there should 
be an encore. It seems this may be the last opportunity 
the von Trapp Family will have to sing together for a 
long, long time. (MARIA and GEORG exchange a 
troubled glance.) I have just been informed that Captain 
von Trapp leaves immediately after the concert for his 
new command in the naval forces of the Third Reich. A 
guard of honor has arrived to escort him directly from 
this hall to the naval base at Bremethaven, (MAX looks 
offstage L.., indicating the presence of the guard of 
honor.) And now, ladies and gentlemen, the family von 
Trapp again. (The CAPTAIN and MARIA confer briefly 
and hurriedly. Then MARIA goes to the children and 
whispers some instructions to them. They line up ac- 
cross the stage and sing with a slight edge of appre- 
hension. MARIA nods to conductor.)

MARIA: (Singing) 
‘There's a sad sort of clanging 
From the clock in the hall 
And the bells in the steeple, too 
And up in the nursery 
An absurd little bird 
Is popping out to say ‘‘coo-coo”” 
CHILDREN; Coo-coo, coo-coo 
CAPTAIN: Regretfully they tell us 
But firmly they compel us 
To say goodbye to you 
ALL So long, farewell, auf wiedersehen, good- 
night. 
KURT and MARTA: 
We hate to go, and miss this pretty sight 
(KURT and MARTA exit S.R., glancing back nervously) 
ALL: So long, farewell, auf wiedersehen, adieu 
FRIEDRICH and LIESL: 
Adieu, adieu, to yieu and yieu and yieu 
(FRIEDRICH and LIESL exit 8.R.) 
ALL: So long, farewell, auf wiedersehen, goodbye. 
LOUISA and BRIGITTA: 
We flit, we float, we fleetly flee, we fly 
(LOUISA and BRIGITTA exit S.R.) 


ALL: So long, farewell, auf wiedersehen, goodbye. 
GRETL: ‘The sun has gone to bed and so must I, 
Goodbye! 
(GRETL. exits S.R.) 
MARIA: Goodbye 
CAPTAIN: Goodbye 
BOTH: Goodbye. 


(MARIA takes the CAPTAIN’s hand and they exit S.R 
MAX joins in the audience’s applause and watches the von 
Trapps off. Then he turns to see an envelope that is being

held out to him from offstage, L. He takes it and goes to the 

microphone.) 

MAX: Ladies and gentlemen, | have here the decision of 
our distinguished judges. (He looks at the paper, then 
looks off after the von Traps. He is stalling.) We will 
start with the third award. For this honor, the judges 
have named the trio of the saengerbund of Herwegen. 

(He gestures R. The trio enters R., bows and exits.) 
The second award has been given to Fraulein Schweiger, 
the first soloist of the choir of St. Agathe’s Church in 
Murbach. (He gestures R. FRAULEIN SCHPEICER en- 
ters R., bows and exits. MAX looks offstage L. as if to 
reassure himself it is safe to proceed.) And the first 
prize—the highest musical honor in the Ostmark—goes 
to the family Von Trapp— (Ile gestures R. The family 
Von Trapp does not appear.) The family Von Trapp 
(He again gestures R. There is a commotion offstage 1.. 
and R.) 

OFF-STAGE VOICES: Where are they—the Von Traps? 
They’re gone! — Gone? — The Von Trapps! — Which way 
did they go? — Where are they? — Call the guard! — 
Hauptmann, take the first road! Ullrich, block the drive- 
way! Steinhardt, call district headquarters! 

(The commotion mounts.) 

MAX: (To the orchestra) Play something! (He exits hurriedly 
L, THE LIGHTS DIM ALMOST TO BLACKNESS, 
Thiee Men in S.S. uniforms run across the stage, 1. to 
R. Whistles and shouting voices are heard.) 


ACT IL 
Scene 7 


The garden of Nonnberg Abbey. The Abbey itself is on 
S.L., and there is alarge single door opening from it into 


-~99- 


the garden. The rear wall of the garden has been hewn out 

of the mountain. [tis low on S.L. and rises sharply to a 

considerable height on S.R. At the rear of the rock wall of 

the garden a path starts about C.S. and goes directly up 

the mountain, disappearing off D.S.R. There is a wooden 

railing on the upstage side of the path. At Rise: The garden 
is in blackness. A few stars are seen in the black sky. 

What little moonlight there is discloses the shadows of 

the VON TRAPP family huddled as if in hiding. They are 

wearing the native capes and hats and have a guitar case. 

Their rucksacks are Lying at their feet. The door from the 

Abbey opens stealthily and SISTER MARGARETTA slips 

through it, closing it behind her. They all speak sotto voce. 

SISTER MARGARETTA: They’ve only five more rooms to 
search. It shouldn’t be long now. 

CAPTAIN: How many of them are there? 

MARGARETTA: I counted only eight storm troopers and 
their officer. 

MARIA: Sister Margaretta, we didn’t know we'd put the 
Abbey in this danger. 

CAPTAIN: It’s outrageous, The church has always been 
sanctuary 

MARGARETTA: Not with these people. This is the third 
time they’ve searched the Abbey, 

MAN’S VOICE: (Offstage) Look there! 

(There is a frightened pause.) 

MARGARETTA: That’s why we put you out here in the 
garden. They always search the inside—never the out- 
side. 

GRETL: (In full voice) Isn't this God’s house? 

CAPTAIN; Ssh! Yes, darling. 

MARGARETTA: (To GRETL) We must all be very, very 
quiet. We'll let you know when they’ve gone (She exits 
into the Abbey.)

MARTA: After they’ve gone, can we go home? 

CAPTAIN: No, darling, we have a long drive ahead of us. 

(LIESL has drifted to the far side of the garden.) 
MARIA: Liesl, let’s all stay close to each other. 

(LIESL starts back as the door L.. opens suddenly. 
ROLF enters dressed in S.S. uniform. He plays a flashlight 
across the stage. The light first reveals MARIA. The 
CAPTAIN starts toward ROLF. ROLF flashes the light 
on the CAPTAIN's face, at the same time drawing his 
pistol. The CAPTAIN stops short.) 

ROLF: (Calling over his shoulder) Lieutenant! (As ROLF’s 
head turns back, his flashlight beams directly on the 
face of LIESL. There is a hushed moment as she looks 
pleadingly at ROLF. From a distance we hear the LIEU- 
TENANT’s footsteps as he approaches. The sound 
draws nearer and nearer. Suddenly ROLF turns and calls 
through the door.) No one out here, sir! 

LIEUTENANT’S VOICE: (Offstage) All right! Come along! 
(The sound of the footsteps now indicates that the 
LIEUTENANT has turned and is walking away. ROLF takes 

one last look at LIESL, then exits quickly, slamming the 

door behind him. LIESL runs into her father’s arms with a 

sob.) 

CAPTAIN: Sh-h-h' (We hear the sound of an automobile 
starting. The family stands frozen. The sound fades 
into the distance.) Thank God! 

(The MOTHER ABBESS and SISTER MARGARETTA 
enter.) 

MOTHER ABBESS: (Full vice) They've gone! 

CAPTAIN: Reverend Mother, we are sorry we brought this 
on you. 

MARIA: (Crosses L. of MOTHER ABBESS) Reverend 
Mother, we can never thank you. 

CAPTAIN: As soon as it’s safe, we'll start. We hid our 
car deep in the woods 


-101- 


MOTHER ABBESS: The car will do you no good. They’ve 
left a guard on the road in front of the gate 

MARGARETTA: I’ve been listening to the wireless, All 
the roads are blocked The border’s been closed 

(CAPTAIN looks at mountain.) 

CAPTAIN: (Crosses D.R.) V've always thought of these 
mountains as my friends—standing there protecting us 
Now they seem to have become my enemies. 

MOTHER ABBESS: Never your enemies. Haven’t you read?— 
“| will lift up mine eyes unto the hills from whence 
cometh my help.” 

MARIA: (Crosses to L. of CAPTAIN) Georg, 1 know that 
mountain as well as ] know this garden. And so do you 
And once we’re over that mountain, we're in Switzer- 
land. 

CAPTAIN: But the children! 

MARIA: We can help them 

KURT: (Crosses to R. of CAPTAIN) Father, we can do it 
without help 

MOTHER ABBESS: (Crosses between MARIA and CAPTAIN) 
You'll have help. “For Ye shall go out with joy, and be 
led forth with peace; the mountains and the hills shall 
break forth before you into singing.” (The lights dim 
D.S. and build U.S. MOTHER ABBESS sings.) 

Follow every rainbow 
Till you find your dream 
(The family, led by MARIA, pick up their rucksacks, 
and start out putting them on. The CAPTAIN picks up 

GRETL. KURT takes guitar case. SISTER BERTHE and 

SISTER SOPHIA enter and join the MOTHER ABBESS in 

singing, as does SISTER MARGARETTA.) 

A dream that will need all the love you can 
give 

Every day of your life for as long as you 
live. 


~ 102 - 


(The other nuns come on and swell the volume of this 
chorus, We see MARIA, followed by the children, start up 
the mountain path. At the rear is the CAPTAIN with 
GRETL on his shoulders.) 

Climb every mountain, 
Ford every stream, 
Follow every rainbow 
Till you find your dream. 

(MARIA and the rest of the family are about to dis- 
appear along the path as~ The Curtain Falls)
