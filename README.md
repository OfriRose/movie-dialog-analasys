Description

This project performs sentiment analysis on a movie script's dialogue to uncover the emotional tone of characters and the overall emotional arc of the film. It's a beginner-friendly data science project that combines text processing with data visualization.

Goals

    Data Cleaning: Transform a raw movie script into a structured dataset.

    Sentiment Analysis: Use a natural language processing library to assign a sentiment score to each line of dialogue.

    Data Visualization: Create charts and plots to visualize key insights from the data, including character-by-character sentiment and the movie's emotional journey over time.

Technologies Used

    Python

    Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

    Matplotlib & Seaborn: For creating clear and compelling visualizations.

    TextBlob: A simple and effective library for sentiment analysis.

    WordCloud: For generating word clouds to visualize common character vocabulary.

    Poetry: For dependency management and project setup.
